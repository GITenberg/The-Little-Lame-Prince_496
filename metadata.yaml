description: "The Little Lame Prince and his Travelling Cloak (often published under\
  \ its shorter title The Little Lame Prince) is a story for children written by Dinah\
  \ Maria Mulock Craik and first published in 1875. In the story, the young Prince\
  \ Dolor, whose legs are paralysed due to a childhood trauma, is exiled to a tower\
  \ in a wasteland. As he grows older, a fairy godmother provides a magical travelling\
  \ cloak so he can see, but not touch, the world. He uses this cloak to go on various\
  \ adventures, and develops great wisdom and empathy in the process. Finally he becomes\
  \ a wise and compassionate ruler of his own land.\nThe author's style was to stimulate\
  \ positive feelings in her young readers so that they would be motivated to adopt\
  \ socially correct actions in whatever circumstances they encountered. She shows\
  \ how imagination (mediated by the cloak) can lead to empathy and enlightened morality.\
  \ However, some critics have found a deeper theme in this story, relating to the\
  \ restricted lives of respectable middle-class British Victorian women that enforced\
  \ helplessness.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
