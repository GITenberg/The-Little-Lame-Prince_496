    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Yes, he was the most beautiful Prince that ever was born.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Of course, being a prince, people said this; but it was true besides. When
      he looked at the candle, his eyes had an expression of earnest inquiry
      quite startling in a new born baby. His nose&mdash;there was not much of
      it certainly, but what there was seemed an aquiline shape; his complexion
      was a charming, healthy purple; he was round and fat, straight-limbed and
      long&mdash;in fact, a splendid baby, and everybody was exceedingly proud
      of him, especially his father and mother, the King and Queen of
      Nomansland, who had waited for him during their happy reign of ten years&mdash;now
      made happier than ever, to themselves and their subjects, by the
      appearance of a son and heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only person who was not quite happy was the King's brother, the heir
      presumptive, who would have been king one day had the baby not been born.
      But as his majesty was very kind to him, and even rather sorry for him&mdash;insomuch
      that at the Queen's request he gave him a dukedom almost as big as a
      county&mdash;the Crown-Prince, as he was called, tried to seem pleased
      also; and let us hope he succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince's christening was to be a grand affair. According to the custom
      of the country, there were chosen for him four-and-twenty god-fathers and
      godmothers, who each had to give him a name, and promise to do their
      utmost for him. When he came of age, he himself had to choose the name&mdash;and
      the godfather or god-mother&mdash;that he liked the best, for the rest of
      his days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime all was rejoicing. Subscriptions were made among the rich to give
      pleasure to the poor; dinners in town-halls for the workingmen;
      tea-parties in the streets for their wives; and milk-and-bun feasts for
      the children in the schoolrooms. For Nomansland, though I cannot point it
      out in any map, or read of it in any history, was, I believe, much like
      our own or many another country.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the palace&mdash;which was no different from other palaces&mdash;it
      was clean "turned out of the windows," as people say, with the
      preparations going on. The only quiet place in it was the room which,
      though the Prince was six weeks old, his mother the Queen had never
      quitted. Nobody said she was ill, however&mdash;it would have been so
      inconvenient; and as she said nothing about it herself, but lay pale and
      placid, giving no trouble to anybody, nobody thought much about her. All
      the world was absorbed in admiring the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      The christening-day came at last, and it was as lovely as the Prince
      himself. All the people in the palace were lovely too&mdash;or thought
      themselves so&mdash;in the elegant new clothes which the Queen, who
      thought of everybody, had taken care to give them, from the
      ladies-in-waiting down to the poor little kitchen-maid, who looked at
      herself in her pink cotton gown, and thought, doubtless, that there never
      was such a pretty girl as she.
    </p>
    <p>
      By six in the morning all the royal household had dressed itself in its
      very best; and then the little Prince was dressed in his best&mdash;his
      magnificent christening robe; which proceeding his Royal Highness did not
      like at all, but kicked and screamed like any common baby. When he had a
      little calmed down, they carried him to be looked at by the Queen his
      mother, who, though her royal robes had been brought and laid upon the
      bed, was, as everybody well knew, quite unable to rise and put them on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She admired her baby very much; kissed and blessed him, and lay looking at
      him, as she did for hours sometimes, when he was placed beside her fast
      asleep; then she gave him up with a gentle smile, and, saying she hoped he
      would be very good, that it would be a very nice christening, and all the
      guests would enjoy themselves, turned peacefully over on her bed, saying
      nothing more to anybody. She was a very uncomplaining person, the Queen&mdash;and
      her name was Dolorez.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything went on exactly as if she had been present. All, even the king
      himself, had grown used to her absence; for she was not strong, and for
      years had not joined in any gayeties. She always did her royal duties, but
      as to pleasures, they could go on quite well without her, or it seemed so.
      The company arrived: great and notable persons in this and neighboring
      countries; also the four-and-twenty godfathers and godmothers, who had
      been chosen with care, as the people who would be most useful to his royal
      highness should he ever want friends, which did not seem likely. What such
      want could possibly happen to the heir of the powerful monarch of
      Nomansland?
    </p>
    <p>
      They came, walking two and two, with their coronets on their heads&mdash;being
      dukes and duchesses, princes and princesses, or the like; they all kissed
      the child and pronounced the name each had given him. Then the
      four-and-twenty names were shouted out with great energy by six heralds,
      one after the other, and afterward written down, to be preserved in the
      state records, in readiness for the next time they were wanted, which
      would be either on his Royal Highness' coronation or his funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the ceremony was over, and everybody satisfied; except, perhaps, the
      little Prince himself, who moaned faintly under his christening robes,
      which nearly smothered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, though very few knew, the Prince in coming to the chapel had met
      with a slight disaster. His nurse,&mdash;not his ordinary one, but the
      state nurse-maid,&mdash;an elegant and fashionable young lady of rank,
      whose duty it was to carry him to and from the chapel, had been so
      occupied in arranging her train with one hand, while she held the baby
      with the other, that she stumbled and let him fall, just at the foot of
      the marble staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, she contrived to pick him up again the next minute; and the
      accident was so slight it seemed hardly worth speaking of. Consequently
      nobody did speak of it. The baby had turned deadly pale, but did not cry,
      so no person a step or two behind could discover anything wrong;
      afterward, even if he had moaned, the silver trumpets were loud enough to
      drown his voice. It would have been a pity to let anything trouble such a
      day of felicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, after a minute's pause, the procession had moved on. Such a procession
      t Heralds in blue and silver; pages in crimson and gold; and a troop of
      little girls in dazzling white, carrying baskets of flowers, which they
      strewed all the way before the nurse and child&mdash;finally the
      four-and-twenty godfathers and godmothers, as proud as possible, and so
      splendid to look at that they would have quite extinguished their small
      godson&mdash;merely a heap of lace and muslin with a baby face inside&mdash;had
      it not been for a canopy of white satin and ostrich feathers which was
      held over him wherever he was carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, with the sun shining on them through the painted windows, they
      stood; the king and his train on one side, the Prince and his attendants
      on the other, as pretty a sight as ever was seen out of fairyland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's just like fairyland," whispered the eldest little girl to the next
      eldest, as she shook the last rose out of her basket; "and I think the
      only thing the Prince wants now is a fairy god-mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does he?" said a shrill but soft and not unpleasant voice behind; and
      there was seen among the group of children somebody,&mdash;not a child,
      yet no bigger than a child,&mdash;somebody whom nobody had seen before,
      and who certainly had not been invited, for she had no christening clothes
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a little old woman dressed all in gray: gray gown; gray hooded
      cloak, of a material excessively fine, and a tint that seemed perpetually
      changing, like the gray of an evening sky. Her hair was gray, and her eyes
      also&mdash;even her complexion had a soft gray shadow over it. But there
      was nothing unpleasantly old about her, and her smile was as sweet and
      childlike as the Prince's own, which stole over his pale little face the
      instant she came near enough to touch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care! Don't let the baby fall again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The grand young lady nurse started, flushing angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who spoke to me? How did anybody know?&mdash;I mean, what business has
      anybody&mdash;&mdash;" Then frightened, but still speaking in a much
      sharper tone than I hope young ladies of rank are in the habit of speaking&mdash;"Old
      woman, you will be kind enough not to say 'the baby,' but 'the Prince.'
      Keep away; his Royal Highness is just going to sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nevertheless I must kiss him. I am his god-mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" cried the elegant lady nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" repeated all the gentlemen and ladies-in-waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" echoed the heralds and pages&mdash;and they began to blow the
      silver trumpets in order to stop all further conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince's procession formed itself for returning,&mdash;the King and
      his train having already moved off toward the palace,&mdash;but on the
      top-most step of the marble stairs stood, right in front of all, the
      little old woman clothed in gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stretched herself on tiptoe by the help of her stick, and gave the
      little Prince three kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is intolerable!" cried the young lady nurse, wiping the kisses off
      rapidly with her lace handkerchief. "Such an insult to his Royal Highness!
      Take yourself out of the way, old woman, or the King shall be informed
      immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The King knows nothing of me, more's the pity," replied the old woman,
      with an indifferent air, as if she thought the loss was more on his
      Majesty's side than hers. "My friend in the palace is the King's wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "King's have not wives, but queens," said the lady nurse, with a
      contemptuous air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," replied the old woman. "Nevertheless I know her Majesty
      well, and I love her and her child. And&mdash;since you dropped him on the
      marble stairs (this she said in a mysterious whisper, which made the young
      lady tremble in spite of her anger)&mdash;I choose to take him for my own,
      and be his godmother, ready to help him whenever he wants me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You help him!" cried all the group breaking into shouts of laughter, to
      which the little old woman paid not the slightest attention. Her soft gray
      eyes were fixed on the Prince, who seemed to answer to the look, smiling
      again and again in the causeless, aimless fashion that babies do smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His Majesty must hear of this," said a gentleman-in-waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His Majesty will hear quite enough news in a minute or two," said the old
      woman sadly. And again stretching up to the little Prince, she kissed him
      on the forehead solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be called by a new name which nobody has ever thought of. Be Prince
      Dolor, in memory of your mother Dolorez."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In memory of!" Everybody started at the ominous phrase, and also at a
      most terrible breach of etiquette which the old woman had committed. In
      Nomansland, neither the king nor the queen was supposed to have any
      Christian name at all. They dropped it on their coronation day, and it
      never was mentioned again till it was engraved on their coffins when they
      died.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old woman, you are exceedingly ill-bred," cried the eldest
      lady-in-waiting, much horrified. "How you could know the fact passes my
      comprehension. But even if you did know it, how dared you presume to hint
      that her most gracious Majesty is called Dolorez?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "WAS called Dolorez," said the old woman, with a tender solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first gentleman, called the Gold-stick-in-waiting, raised it to strike
      her, and all the rest stretched out their hands to seize her; but the gray
      mantle melted from between their fingers like air; and, before anybody had
      time to do anything more, there came a heavy, muffled, startling sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great bell of the palace the bell which was only heard on the death of
      some one of the royal family, and for as many times as he or she was years
      old&mdash;began to toll. They listened, mute and horror-stricken. Some one
      counted: one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;up to nine-and-twenty&mdash;just
      the Queen's age.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, indeed, the Queen. Her Majesty was dead! In the midst of the
      festivities she had slipped away out of her new happiness and her old
      sufferings, not few nor small. Sending away all her women to see the grand
      sight,&mdash;at least they said afterward, in excuse, that she had done
      so, and it was very like her to do it,&mdash;she had turned with her face
      to the window, whence one could just see the tops of the distant mountains&mdash;the
      Beautiful Mountains, as they were called&mdash;where she was born. So
      gazing, she had quietly died.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the little Prince was carried back to his mother's room, there was no
      mother to kiss him. And, though he did not know it, there would be for him
      no mother's kiss any more. As for his godmother,&mdash;the little old
      woman in gray who called herself so,&mdash;whether she melted into air,
      like her gown when they touched it, or whether she flew out of the chapel
      window, or slipped through the doorway among the bewildered crowd, nobody
      knew&mdash;nobody ever thought about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the nurse, the ordinary homely one, coming out of the Prince's
      nursery in the middle of the night in search of a cordial to quiet his
      continual moans, saw, sitting in the doorway, something which she would
      have thought a mere shadow, had she not seen shining out of it two eyes,
      gray and soft and sweet. She put her hand before her own, screaming
      loudly. When she took them away the old woman was gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Everybody was very kind to the poor little prince. I think people
      generally are kind to motherless children, whether princes or peasants. He
      had a magnificent nursery and a regular suite of attendants, and was
      treated with the greatest respect and state. Nobody was allowed to talk to
      him in silly baby language, or dandle him, or, above all to kiss him,
      though perhaps some people did it surreptitiously, for he was such a sweet
      baby that it was difficult to help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could not be said that the Prince missed his mother&mdash;children of
      his age cannot do that; but somehow after she died everything seemed to go
      wrong with him. From a beautiful baby he became sickly and pale, seeming
      to have almost ceased growing, especially in his legs, which had been so
      fat and strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after the day of his christening they withered and shrank; he no
      longer kicked them out either in passion or play, and when, as he got to
      be nearly a year old, his nurse tried to make him stand upon them, he only
      tumbled down.

    <p>
      This happened so many times that at last people began to talk about it. A
      prince, and not able to stand on his own legs! What a dreadful thing! What
      a misfortune for the country!
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather a misfortune to him also, poor little boy! but nobody seemed to
      think of that. And when, after a while, his health revived, and the old
      bright look came back to his sweet little face, and his body grew larger
      and stronger, though still his legs remained the same, people continued to
      speak of him in whispers, and with grave shakes of the head. Everybody
      knew, though nobody said it, that something, it was impossible to guess
      what, was not quite right with the poor little Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, nobody hinted this to the King his father: it does not do to
      tell great people anything unpleasant. And besides, his Majesty took very
      little notice of his son, or of his other affairs, beyond the necessary
      duties of his kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      People had said he would not miss the Queen at all, she having been so
      long an invalid, but he did. After her death he never was quite the same.
      He established himself in her empty rooms, the only rooms in the palace
      whence one could see the Beautiful Mountains, and was often observed
      looking at them as if he thought she had flown away thither, and that his
      longing could bring her back again. And by a curious coincidence, which
      nobody dared inquire into, he desired that the Prince might be called, not
      by any of the four-and-twenty grand names given him by his godfathers and
      godmothers, but by the identical name mentioned by the little old woman in
      gray&mdash;Dolor, after his mother Dolorez.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a week, according to established state custom, the Prince, dressed in
      his very best, was brought to the King his father for half an hour, but
      his Majesty was generally too ill and too melancholy to pay much heed to
      the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once, when he and the Crown-Prince, who was exceedingly attentive to
      his royal brother, were sitting together, with Prince Dolor playing in a
      corner of the room, dragging himself about with his arms rather than his
      legs, and sometimes trying feebly to crawl from one chair to another, it
      seemed to strike the father that all was not right with his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How old is his Royal Highness?" said he suddenly to the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two years, three months, and five days, please your Majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does not please me," said the King, with a sigh. "He ought to be far
      more forward than he is now ought he not, brother? You, who have so many
      children, must know. Is there not something wrong about him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," said the Crown-Prince, exchanging meaning looks with the nurse,
      who did not understand at all, but stood frightened and trembling with the
      tears in her eyes. "Nothing to make your Majesty at all uneasy. No doubt
      his Royal Highness will outgrow it in time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Outgrow&mdash;what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A slight delicacy&mdash;ahem!&mdash;in the spine; something inherited,
      perhaps, from his dear mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, she was always delicate; but she was the sweetest woman that ever
      lived. Come here, my little son."
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the Prince turned round upon his father a small, sweet, grave face,&mdash;so
      like his mother's,&mdash;his Majesty the King smiled and held out his
      arms. But when the boy came to him, not running like a boy, but wriggling
      awkwardly along the floor, the royal countenance clouded over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to have been told of this. It is terrible&mdash;terrible! And for
      a prince too. Send for all the doctors in my kingdom immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      They came, and each gave a different opinion and ordered a different mode
      of treatment. The only thing they agreed in was what had been pretty well
      known before, that the Prince must have been hurt when he was an infant&mdash;let
      fall, perhaps, so as to injure his spine and lower limbs. Did nobody
      remember?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, nobody. Indignantly, all the nurses denied that any such accident had
      happened, was possible to have happened, until the faithful country nurse
      recollected that it really had happened on the day of the christening. For
      which unluckily good memory all the others scolded her so severely that
      she had no peace of her life, and soon after, by the influence of the
      young lady nurse who had carried the baby that fatal day, and who was a
      sort of connection of the Crown-Prince&mdash;being his wife's second
      cousin once removed&mdash;the poor woman was pensioned off and sent to the
      Beautiful Mountains from whence she came, with orders to remain there for
      the rest of her days.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of all this the King knew nothing, for, indeed, after the first shock
      of finding out that his son could not walk, and seemed never likely to he
      interfered very little concerning him. The whole thing was too painful,
      and his Majesty never liked painful things. Sometimes he inquired after
      Prince Dolor, and they told him his Royal Highness was going on as well as
      could be expected, which really was the case. For, after worrying the poor
      child and perplexing themselves with one remedy after another, the
      Crown-Prince, not wishing to offend any of the differing doctors, had
      proposed leaving him to Nature; and Nature, the safest doctor of all, had
      come to his help and done her best.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not walk, it is true; his limbs were mere useless appendages to
      his body; but the body itself was strong and sound. And his face was the
      same as ever&mdash;just his mother's face, one of the sweetest in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the King, indifferent as he was, sometimes looked at the little
      fellow with sad tenderness, noticing how cleverly he learned to crawl and
      swing himself about by his arms, so that in his own awkward way he was as
      active in motion as most children of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor little man! he does his best, and he is not unhappy&mdash;not half
      so unhappy as I, brother," addressing the Crown-Prince, who was more
      constant than ever in his attendance upon the sick monarch. "If anything
      should befall me, I have appointed you Regent. In case of my death, you
      will take care of my poor little boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, certainly; but do not let us imagine any such misfortune. I
      assure your Majesty&mdash;everybody will assure you&mdash;that it is not
      in the least likely."
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew, however, and everybody knew, that it was likely, and soon after
      it actually did happen. The King died as suddenly and quietly as the Queen
      had done&mdash;indeed, in her very room and bed; and Prince Dolor was left
      without either father or mother&mdash;as sad a thing as could happen, even
      to a prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was more than that now, though. He was a king. In Nomansland, as in
      other countries, the people were struck with grief one day and revived the
      next. "The king is dead&mdash;long live the king!" was the cry that rang
      through the nation, and almost before his late Majesty had been laid
      beside the Queen in their splendid mausoleum, crowds came thronging from
      all parts to the royal palace, eager to see the new monarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did see him,&mdash;the Prince Regent took care they should,&mdash;sitting
      on the floor of the council chamber, sucking his thumb! And when one of
      the gentlemen-in-waiting lifted him up and carried him&mdash;fancy
      carrying a king!&mdash;to the chair of state, and put the crown on his
      head, he shook it off again, it was so heavy and uncomfortable. Sliding
      down to the foot of the throne he began playing with the golden lions that
      supported it, stroking their paws and putting his tiny fingers into their
      eyes, and laughing&mdash;laughing as if he had at last found something to
      amuse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a fine king for you!" said the first lord-in-waiting, a friend of
      the Prince Regent's (the Crown-Prince that used to be, who, in the deepest
      mourning, stood silently beside the throne of his young nephew. He was a
      handsome man, very grand and clever-looking). "What a king! who can never
      stand to receive his subjects, never walk in processions, who to the last
      day of his life will have to be carried about like a baby. Very
      unfortunate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exceedingly unfortunate," repeated the second lord. "It is always bad for
      a nation when its king is a child; but such a child&mdash;a permanent
      cripple, if not worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us hope not worse," said the first lord in a very hopeless tone, and
      looking toward the Regent, who stood erect and pretended to hear nothing.
      "I have heard that these sort of children with very large heads, and great
      broad fore-heads and staring eyes, are&mdash;well, well, let us hope for
      the best and be prepared for the worst. In the meantime&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I swear," said the Crown-Prince, coming forward and kissing the hilt of
      his sword&mdash;"I swear to perform my duties as Regent, to take all care
      of his Royal Highness&mdash;his Majesty, I mean," with a grand bow to the
      little child, who laughed innocently back again. "And I will do my humble
      best to govern the country. Still, if the country has the slightest
      objection&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Crown-Prince being generalissimo, having the whole army at his
      beck and call, so that he could have begun a civil war in no time, the
      country had, of course, not the slightest objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the King and Queen slept together in peace, and Prince Dolor reigned
      over the land&mdash;that is, his uncle did; and everybody said what a
      fortunate thing it was for the poor little Prince to have such a clever
      uncle to take care of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All things went on as usual; indeed, after the Regent had brought his wife
      and her seven sons, and established them in the palace, rather better than
      usual. For they gave such splendid entertainments and made the capital so
      lively that trade revived, and the country was said to be more flourishing
      than it had been for a century. Whenever the Regent and his sons appeared,
      they were received with shouts: "Long live the Crown-Prince!" "Long live
      the royal family!" And, in truth, they were very fine children, the whole
      seven of them, and made a great show when they rode out together on seven
      beautiful horses, one height above another, down to the youngest, on his
      tiny black pony, no bigger than a large dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the other child, his Royal Highness Prince Dolor,&mdash;for somehow
      people soon ceased to call him his Majesty, which seemed such a ridiculous
      title for a poor little fellow, a helpless cripple,&mdash;with only head
      and trunk, and no legs to speak of,&mdash;he was seen very seldom by
      anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes people daring enough to peer over the high wall of the palace
      garden noticed there, carried in a footman's arms, or drawn in a chair, or
      left to play on the grass, often with nobody to mind him, a pretty little
      boy, with a bright, intelligent face and large, melancholy eyes&mdash;no,
      not exactly melancholy, for they were his mother's, and she was by no
      means sad-minded, but thoughtful and dreamy. They rather perplexed people,
      those childish eyes; they were so exceedingly innocent and yet so
      penetrating. If anybody did a wrong thing&mdash;told a lie, for instance
      they would turn round with such a grave, silent surprise the child never
      talked much&mdash;that every naughty person in the palace was rather
      afraid of Prince Dolor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not help it, and perhaps he did not even know it, being no better
      a child than many other children, but there was something about him which
      made bad people sorry, and grumbling people ashamed of themselves, and
      ill-natured people gentle and kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose because they were touched to see a poor little fellow who did
      not in the least know what had befallen him or what lay before him, living
      his baby life as happy as the day is long. Thus, whether or not he was
      good himself, the sight of him and his affliction made other people good,
      and, above all, made everybody love him&mdash;so much so, that his uncle
      the Regent began to feel a little uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I have nothing to say against uncles in general. They are usually
      very excellent people, and very convenient to little boys and girls. Even
      the "cruel uncle" of the "Babes in the Wood" I believe to be quite an
      exceptional character. And this "cruel uncle" of whom I am telling was, I
      hope, an exception, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not mean to be cruel. If anybody had called him so, he would have
      resented it extremely: he would have said that what he did was done
      entirely for the good of the country. But he was a man who had always been
      accustomed to consider himself first and foremost, believing that whatever
      he wanted was sure to be right, and therefore he ought to have it. So he
      tried to get it, and got it too, as people like him very often do. Whether
      they enjoy it when they have it is another question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore he went one day to the council chamber, determined on making a
      speech, and informing the ministers and the country at large that the
      young King was in failing health, and that it would be advisable to send
      him for a time to the Beautiful Mountains. Whether he really meant to do
      this, or whether it occurred to him afterward that there would be an
      easier way of attaining his great desire, the crown of Nomansland, is a
      point which I cannot decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      But soon after, when he had obtained an order in council to send the King
      away, which was done in great state, with a guard of honor composed of two
      whole regiments of soldiers,&mdash;the nation learned, without much
      surprise, that the poor little Prince&mdash;nobody ever called him king
      now&mdash;had gone a much longer journey than to the Beautiful Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had fallen ill on the road and died within a few hours; at least so
      declared the physician in attendance and the nurse who had been sent to
      take care of him. They brought his coffin back in great state, and buried
      it in the mausoleum with his parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Prince Dolor was seen no more. The country went into deep mourning for
      him, and then forgot him, and his uncle reigned in his stead. That
      illustrious personage accepted his crown with great decorum, and wore it
      with great dignity to the last. But whether he enjoyed it or not there is
      no evidence to show.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      And what of the little lame Prince, whom everybody seemed so easily to
      have forgotten?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not everybody. There were a few kind souls, mothers of families, who had
      heard his sad story, and some servants about the palace, who had been
      familiar with his sweet ways&mdash;these many a time sighed and said,
      "Poor Prince Dolor!" Or, looking at the Beautiful Mountains, which were
      visible all over Nomansland, though few people ever visited them, "Well,
      perhaps his Royal Highness is better where he is than even there."
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not know&mdash;indeed, hardly anybody did know&mdash;that beyond
      the mountains, between them and the sea, lay a tract of country, barren,
      level, bare, except for short, stunted grass, and here and there a patch
      of tiny flowers. Not a bush&mdash;not a tree not a resting place for bird
      or beast was in that dreary plain. In summer the sunshine fell upon it
      hour after hour with a blinding glare; in winter the winds and rains swept
      over it unhindered, and the snow came down steadily, noiselessly, covering
      it from end to end in one great white sheet, which lay for days and weeks
      unmarked by a single footprint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a pleasant place to live in&mdash;and nobody did live there,
      apparently. The only sign that human creatures had ever been near the spot
      was one large round tower which rose up in the center of the plain, and
      might be seen all over it&mdash;if there had been anybody to see, which
      there never was. Rose right up out of the ground, as if it had grown of
      itself, like a mushroom. But it was not at all mushroom-like; on the
      contrary, it was very solidly built. In form it resembled the Irish round
      towers, which have puzzled people for so long, nobody being able to find
      out when, or by whom, or for what purpose they were made; seemingly for no
      use at all, like this tower. It was circular, of very firm brickwork, with
      neither doors nor windows, until near the top, when you could perceive
      some slits in the wall through which one might possibly creep in or look
      out. Its height was nearly a hundred feet, and it had a battlemented
      parapet showing sharp against the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the plain was quite desolate&mdash;almost like a desert, only without
      sand, and led to nowhere except the still more desolate seacoast&mdash;nobody
      ever crossed it. Whatever mystery there was about the tower, it and the
      sky and the plain kept their secret to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very great secret indeed,&mdash;a state secret,&mdash;which none
      but so clever a man as the present King of Nomansland would ever have
      thought of. How he carried it out, undiscovered, I cannot tell. People
      said, long afterward, that it was by means of a gang of condemned
      criminals, who were set to work, and executed immediately after they had
      done, so that nobody knew anything, or in the least suspected the real
      fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what was the fact? Why, that this tower, which seemed a mere mass of
      masonry, utterly forsaken and uninhabited, was not so at all. Within
      twenty feet of the top some ingenious architect had planned a perfect
      little house, divided into four rooms&mdash;as by drawing a cross within a
      circle you will see might easily be done. By making skylights, and a few
      slits in the walls for windows, and raising a peaked roof which was hidden
      by the parapet, here was a dwelling complete, eighty feet from the ground,
      and as inaccessible as a rook's nest on the top of a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      A charming place to live in! if you once got up there,&mdash;and never
      wanted to come down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside&mdash;though nobody could have looked inside except a bird, and
      hardly even a bird flew past that lonely tower&mdash;inside it was
      furnished with all the comfort and elegance imaginable; with lots of books
      and toys, and everything that the heart of a child could desire. For its
      only inhabitant, except a nurse of course, was a poor solitary child.
    </p>
    <p>
      One winter night, when all the plain was white with moonlight, there was
      seen crossing it a great tall black horse, ridden by a man also big and
      equally black, carrying before him on the saddle a woman and a child. The
      woman&mdash;she had a sad, fierce look, and no wonder, for she was a
      criminal under sentence of death, but her sentence had been changed to
      almost as severe a punishment. She was to inhabit the lonely tower with
      the child, and was allowed to live as long as the child lived&mdash;no
      longer. This in order that she might take the utmost care of him; for
      those who put him there were equally afraid of his dying and of his
      living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he was only a little gentle boy, with a sweet, sleepy smile&mdash;he
      had been very tired with his long journey&mdash;and clinging arms, which
      held tight to the man's neck, for he was rather frightened, and the face,
      black as it was, looked kindly at him. And he was very helpless, with his
      poor, small shriveled legs, which could neither stand nor run away&mdash;for
      the little forlorn boy was Prince Dolor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been dead at all&mdash;or buried either. His grand funeral had
      been a mere pretense: a wax figure having been put in his place, while he
      himself was spirited away under charge of these two, the condemned woman
      and the black man. The latter was deaf and dumb, so could neither tell nor
      repeat anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the foot of the tower, there was light enough to see a
      huge chain dangling from the parapet, but dangling only halfway. The
      deaf-mute took from his saddle-wallet a sort of ladder, arranged in pieces
      like a puzzle, fitted it together, and lifted it up to meet the chain.
      Then he mounted to the top of the tower, and slung from it a sort of
      chair, in which the woman and the child placed themselves and were drawn
      up, never to come down again as long as they lived. Leaving them there,
      the man descended the ladder, took it to pieces again and packed it in his
      pack, mounted the horse and disappeared across the plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every month they used to watch for him, appearing like a speck in the
      distance. He fastened his horse to the foot of the tower, and climbed it,
      as before, laden with provisions and many other things. He always saw the
      Prince, so as to make sure that the child was alive and well, and then
      went away until the following month.
    </p>
    <p>
      While his first childhood lasted Prince Dolor was happy enough. He had
      every luxury that even a prince could need, and the one thing wanting,&mdash;love,&mdash;never
      having known, he did not miss. His nurse was very kind to him though she
      was a wicked woman. But either she had not been quite so wicked as people
      said, or she grew better through being shut up continually with a little
      innocent child who was dependent upon her for every comfort and pleasure
      of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not an unhappy life. There was nobody to tease or ill-use him, and
      he was never ill. He played about from room to room&mdash;there were four
      rooms, parlor, kitchen, his nurse's bedroom, and his own; learned to crawl
      like a fly, and to jump like a frog, and to run about on all-fours almost
      as fast as a puppy. In fact, he was very much like a puppy or a kitten, as
      thoughtless and as merry&mdash;scarcely ever cross, though sometimes a
      little weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he grew older, he occasionally liked to be quiet for a while, and then
      he would sit at the slits of windows&mdash;which were, however, much
      bigger than they looked from the bottom of the tower&mdash;and watch the
      sky above and the ground below, with the storms sweeping over and the
      sunshine coming and going, and the shadows of the clouds running races
      across the blank plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by he began to learn lessons&mdash;not that his nurse had been
      ordered to teach him, but she did it partly to amuse herself. She was not
      a stupid woman, and Prince Dolor was by no means a stupid boy; so they got
      on very well, and his continual entreaty, "What can I do? what can you
      find me to do?" was stopped, at least for an hour or two in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dull life, but he had never known any other; anyhow, he
      remembered no other, and he did not pity himself at all. Not for a long
      time, till he grew quite a big little boy, and could read quite easily.
      Then he suddenly took to books, which the deaf-mute brought him from time
      to time&mdash;books which, not being acquainted with the literature of
      Nomansland, I cannot describe, but no doubt they were very interesting;
      and they informed him of everything in the outside world, and filled him
      with an intense longing to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time a change came over the boy. He began to look sad and thin,
      and to shut himself up for hours without speaking. For his nurse hardly
      spoke, and whatever questions he asked beyond their ordinary daily life
      she never answered. She had, indeed, been forbidden, on pain of death, to
      tell him anything about himself, who he was, or what he might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew he was Prince Dolor, because she always addressed him as "My
      Prince" and "Your Royal Highness," but what a prince was he had not the
      least idea. He had no idea of anything in the world, except what he found
      in his books.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat one day surrounded by them, having built them up round him like a
      little castle wall. He had been reading them half the day, but feeling all
      the while that to read about things which you never can see is like
      hearing about a beautiful dinner while you are starving. For almost the
      first time in his life he grew melancholy; his hands fell on his lap; he
      sat gazing out of the window-slit upon the view outside&mdash;the view he
      had looked at every day of his life, and might look at for endless days
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a very cheerful view,&mdash;just the plain and the sky,&mdash;but he
      liked it. He used to think, if he could only fly out of that window, up to
      the sky or down to the plain, how nice it would be! Perhaps when he died&mdash;his
      nurse had told him once in anger that he would never leave the tower till
      he died&mdash;he might be able to do this. Not that he understood much
      what dying meant, but it must be a change, and any change seemed to him a
      blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I wish I had somebody to tell me all about it&mdash;about that and
      many other things; somebody that would be fond of me, like my poor white
      kitten."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the tears came into his eyes, for the boy's one friend, the one
      interest of his life, had been a little white kitten, which the deaf-mute,
      kindly smiling, once took out of his pocket and gave him&mdash;the only
      living creature Prince Dolor had ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      For four weeks it was his constant plaything and companion, till one
      moonlight night it took a fancy for wandering, climbed on to the parapet
      of the tower, dropped over and disappeared. It was not killed, he hoped,
      for cats have nine lives; indeed, he almost fancied he saw it pick itself
      up and scamper away; but he never caught sight of it more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I wish I had something better than a kitten&mdash;a person, a real
      live person, who would be fond of me and kind to me. Oh, I want somebody&mdash;dreadfully,
      dreadfully!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, there sounded behind him a slight tap-tap-tap, as of a stick
      or a cane, and twisting himself round, he saw&mdash;what do you think he
      saw?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing either frightening or ugly, but still exceedingly curious. A
      little woman, no bigger than he might himself have been had his legs grown
      like those of other children; but she was not a child&mdash;she was an old
      woman. Her hair was gray, and her dress was gray, and there was a gray
      shadow over her wherever she moved. But she had the sweetest smile, the
      prettiest hands, and when she spoke it was in the softest voice
      imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear little boy,"&mdash;and dropping her cane, the only bright and
      rich thing about her, she laid those two tiny hands on his shoulders,&mdash;"my
      own little boy, I could not come to you until you had said you wanted me;
      but now you do want me, here I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are very welcome, madam," replied the Prince, trying to speak
      politely, as princes always did in books; "and I am exceedingly obliged to
      you. May I ask who you are? Perhaps my mother?" For he knew that little
      boys usually had a mother, and had occasionally wondered what had become
      of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the visitor, with a tender, half-sad smile, putting back the
      hair from his forehead, and looking right into his eyes&mdash;"no, I am
      not your mother, though she was a dear friend of mine; and you are as like
      her as ever you can be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you tell her to come and see me, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She cannot; but I dare say she knows all about you. And she loves you
      very much&mdash;and so do I; and I want to help you all I can, my poor
      little boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you call me poor?" asked Prince Dolor, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little old woman glanced down on his legs and feet, which he did not
      know were different from those of other children, and then at his sweet,
      bright face, which, though he knew not that either, was exceedingly
      different from many children's faces, which are often so fretful, cross,
      sullen. Looking at him, instead of sighing, she smiled. "I beg your
      pardon, my Prince," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am a prince, and my name is Dolor; will you tell me yours, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The little old woman laughed like a chime of silver bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not got a name&mdash;or, rather, I have so many names that I don't
      know which to choose. However, it was I who gave you yours, and you will
      belong to me all your days. I am your godmother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurrah!" cried the little Prince; "I am glad I belong to you, for I like
      you very much. Will you come and play with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      So they sat down together and played. By and by they began to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you very dull here?" asked the little old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not particularly, thank you, godmother. I have plenty to eat and drink,
      and my lessons to do, and my books to read&mdash;lots of books."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you want nothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing. Yes&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&mdash;If you please, godmother, could
      you bring me just one more thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little boy to play with."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman looked very sad. "Just the thing, alas I which I cannot give
      you. My child, I cannot alter your lot in any way, but I can help you to
      bear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. But why do you talk of bearing it? I have nothing to bear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor little man!" said the old woman in the very tenderest tone of her
      tender voice. "Kiss me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is kissing?" asked the wondering child.
    </p>
    <p>
      His godmother took him in her arms and embraced him many times. By and by
      he kissed her back again&mdash;at first awkwardly and shyly, then with all
      the strength of his warm little heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are better to cuddle than even my white kitten, I think. Promise me
      that you will never go away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must; but I will leave a present behind me,&mdash;something as good as
      myself to amuse you,&mdash;something that will take you wherever you want
      to go, and show you all that you wish to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A traveling-cloak."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince's countenance fell. "I don't want a cloak, for I never go out.
      Sometimes nurse hoists me on to the roof, and carries me round by the
      parapet; but that is all. I can't walk, you know, as she does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The more reason why you should ride; and besides, this traveling-cloak&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!&mdash;she's coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      There sounded outside the room door a heavy step and a grumpy voice, and a
      rattle of plates and dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my nurse, and she is bringing my dinner; but I don't want dinner at
      all&mdash;I only want you. Will her coming drive you away, godmother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps; but only for a little while. Never mind; all the bolts and bars
      in the world couldn't keep me out. I'd fly in at the window, or down
      through the chimney. Only wish for me, and I come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Prince Dolor, but almost in a whisper, for he was very
      uneasy at what might happen next. His nurse and his godmother&mdash;what
      would they say to one another? how would they look at one another?&mdash;two
      such different faces: one harsh-lined, sullen, cross, and sad; the other
      sweet and bright and calm as a summer evening before the dark begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door was flung open, Prince Dolor shut his eyes, trembling all
      over; opening them again, he saw he need fear nothing&mdash;his lovely old
      godmother had melted away just like the rainbow out of the sky, as he had
      watched it many a time. Nobody but his nurse was in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a muddle your Royal Highness is sitting in," said she sharply. "Such
      a heap of untidy books; and what's this rubbish?" knocking a little bundle
      that lay beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing, nothing&mdash;give it me!" cried the Prince, and, darting
      after it, he hid it under his pinafore, and then pushed it quickly into
      his pocket. Rubbish as it was, it was left in the place where she sat, and
      might be something belonging to her&mdash;his dear, kind godmother, whom
      already he loved with all his lonely, tender, passionate heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, though he did not know this, his wonderful traveling-cloak.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      And what of the traveling-cloak? What sort of cloak was it, and what A
      good did it do the Prince?
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay, and I'll tell you all about it. Outside it was the commonest-looking
      bundle imaginable&mdash;shabby and small; and the instant Prince Dolor
      touched it, it grew smaller still, dwindling down till he could put it in
      his trousers pocket, like a handkerchief rolled up into a ball. He did
      this at once, for fear his nurse should see it, and kept it there all day&mdash;all
      night, too. Till after his next morning's lessons he had no opportunity of
      examining his treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he did, it seemed no treasure at all; but a mere piece of cloth&mdash;circular
      in form, dark green in color&mdash;that is, if it had any color at all,
      being so worn and shabby, though not dirty. It had a split cut to the
      center, forming a round hole for the neck&mdash;and that was all its
      shape; the shape, in fact, of those cloaks which in South America are
      called ponchos&mdash;very simple, but most graceful and convenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor had never seen anything like it. In spite of his
      disappointment, he examined it curiously; spread it out on the door, then
      arranged it on his shoulders. It felt very warm and comfortable; but it
      was so exceedingly shabby&mdash;the only shabby thing that the Prince had
      ever seen in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what use will it be to me?" said he sadly. "I have no need of outdoor
      clothes, as I never go out. Why was this given me, I wonder? and what in
      the world am I to do with it? She must be a rather funny person, this dear
      godmother of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, because she was his godmother, and had given him the cloak,
      he folded it carefully and put it away, poor and shabby as it was, hiding
      it in a safe corner of his top cupboard, which his nurse never meddled
      with. He did not want her to find it, or to laugh at it or at his
      godmother&mdash;as he felt sure she would, if she knew all.
    </p>
    <p>
      There it lay, and by and by he forgot all about it; nay, I am sorry to say
      that, being but a child, and not seeing her again, he almost forgot his
      sweet old godmother, or thought of her only as he did of the angels or
      fairies that he read of in his books, and of her visit as if it had been a
      mere dream of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were times, certainly, when he recalled her: of early mornings, like
      that morning when she appeared beside him, and late evenings, when the
      gray twilight reminded him of the color of her hair and her pretty soft
      garments; above all, when, waking in the middle of the night, with the
      stars peering in at his window, or the moonlight shining across his little
      bed, he would not have been surprised to see her standing beside it,
      looking at him with those beautiful tender eyes, which seemed to have a
      pleasantness and comfort in them different from anything he had ever
      known.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she never came, and gradually she slipped out of his memory&mdash;only
      a boy's memory, after all; until something happened which made him
      remember her, and want her as he had never wanted anything before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor fell ill. He caught&mdash;his nurse could not tell how&mdash;a
      complaint common to the people of Nomansland, called the doldrums, as
      unpleasant as measles or any other of our complaints; and it made him
      restless, cross, and disagreeable. Even when a little better, he was too
      weak to enjoy anything, but lay all day long on his sofa, fidgeting his
      nurse extremely&mdash;while, in her intense terror lest he might die, she
      fidgeted him still more. At last, seeing he really was getting well, she
      left him to himself&mdash;which he was most glad of, in spite of his
      dullness and dreariness. There he lay, alone, quite alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then an irritable fit came over him, in which he longed to get up
      and do something, or to go somewhere&mdash;would have liked to imitate his
      white kitten&mdash;jump down from the tower and run away, taking the
      chance of whatever might happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one thing, alas! was likely to happen; for the kitten, he remembered,
      had four active legs, while he&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder what my godmother meant when she looked at my legs and sighed so
      bitterly? I wonder why I can't walk straight and steady like my nurse only
      I wouldn't like to have her great, noisy, clumping shoes. Still it would
      be very nice to move about quickly&mdash;perhaps to fly, like a bird, like
      that string of birds I saw the other day skimming across the sky, one
      after the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the passage-birds&mdash;the only living creatures that ever
      crossed the lonely plain; and he had been much interested in them,
      wonder-ing whence they came and whither they were going.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How nice it must be to be a bird! If legs are no good, why cannot one
      have wings? People have wings when they die&mdash;perhaps; I wish I were
      dead, that I do. I am so tired, so tired; and nobody cares for me. Nobody
      ever did care for me, except perhaps my godmother. Godmother, dear, have
      you quite forsaken me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stretched himself wearily, gathered himself up, and dropped his head
      upon his hands; as he did so, he felt somebody kiss him at the back of his
      neck, and, turning, found that he was resting, not on the sofa pillows,
      but on a warm shoulder&mdash;that of the little old woman clothed in gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      How glad he was to see her! How he looked into her kind eyes and felt her
      hands, to see if she were all real and alive! then put both his arms round
      her neck, and kissed her as if he would never have done kissing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, stop!" cried she, pretending to be smothered. "I see you have not
      forgotten my teachings. Kissing is a good thing&mdash;in moderation. Only
      just let me have breath to speak one word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dozen!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, tell me all that has happened to you since I saw you&mdash;or,
      rather, since you saw me, which is quite a different thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing has happened&mdash;nothing ever does happen to me," answered the
      Prince dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are you very dull, my boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So dull that I was just thinking whether I could not jump down to the
      bottom of the tower, like my white kitten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't do that, not being a white kitten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I were&mdash;I wish I were anything but what I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you can't make yourself any different, nor can I do it either. You
      must be content to stay just what you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      The little old woman said this&mdash;very firmly, but gently, too&mdash;with
      her arms round his neck and her lips on his forehead. It was the first
      time the boy had ever heard any one talk like this, and he looked up in
      surprise&mdash;but not in pain, for her sweet manner softened the hardness
      of her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my Prince,&mdash;for you are a prince, and must behave as such,&mdash;let
      us see what we can do; how much I can do for you, or show you how to do
      for yourself. Where is your traveling-cloak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor blushed extremely. "I&mdash;I put it away in the cupboard; I
      suppose it is there still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have never used it; you dislike it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, no; wishing to be impolite. "Don't you think it's&mdash;just
      a little old and shabby for a prince?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman laughed&mdash;long and loud, though very sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prince, indeed! Why, if all the princes in the world craved for it, they
      couldn't get it, unless I gave it them. Old and shabby! It's the most
      valuable thing imaginable! Very few ever have it; but I thought I would
      give it to you, because&mdash;because you are different from other
      people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I?" said the Prince, and looked first with curiosity, then with a sort
      of anxiety, into his godmother's face, which was sad and grave, with slow
      tears beginning to steal down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched his poor little legs. "These are not like those of other
      little boys."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!&mdash;my nurse never told me that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely not. But it is time you were told; and I tell you, because I
      love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me what, dear godmother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you will never be able to walk or run or jump or play&mdash;that
      your life will be quite different from most people's lives; but it may be
      a very happy life for all that. Do not be afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not afraid," said the boy; but he turned very pale, and his lips
      began to quiver, though he did not actually cry&mdash;he was too old for
      that, and, perhaps, too proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though not wholly comprehending, he began dimly to guess what his
      godmother meant. He had never seen any real live boys, but he had seen
      pictures of them running and jumping; which he had admired and tried hard
      to imitate but always failed. Now he began to understand why he failed,
      and that he always should fail&mdash;that, in fact, he was not like other
      little boys; and it was of no use his wishing to do as they did, and play
      as they played, even if he had had them to play with. His was a separate
      life, in which he must find out new work and new pleasures for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense of THE INEVITABLE, as grown-up people call it&mdash;that we
      cannot have things as we want them to be, but as they are, and that we
      must learn to bear them and make the best of them&mdash;this lesson, which
      everybody has to learn soon or late&mdash;came, alas! sadly soon, to the
      poor boy. He fought against it for a while, and then, quite overcome,
      turned and sobbed bitterly in his godmother's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      She comforted him&mdash;I do not know how, except that love always
      comforts; and then she whispered to him, in her sweet, strong, cheerful
      voice: "Never mind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't think I do mind&mdash;that is, I WON'T mind," replied he,
      catching the courage of her tone and speaking like a man, though he was
      still such a mere boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is right, my Prince!&mdash;that is being like a prince. Now we know
      exactly where we are; let us put our shoulders to the wheel and&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are in Hopeless Tower" (this was its name, if it had a name), "and
      there is no wheel to put our shoulders to," said the child sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You little matter-of-fact goose! Well for you that you have a godmother
      called&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" he eagerly asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stuff-and-nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stuff-and-nonsense! What a funny name!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some people give it me, but they are not my most intimate friends. These
      call me&mdash;never mind what," added the old woman, with a soft twinkle
      in her eyes. "So as you know me, and know me well, you may give me any
      name you please; it doesn't matter. But I am your godmother, child. I have
      few godchildren; those I have love me dearly, and find me the greatest
      blessing in all the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can well believe it," cried the little lame Prince, and forgot his
      troubles in looking at her&mdash;as her figure dilated, her eyes grew
      lustrous as stars, her very raiment brightened, and the whole room seemed
      filled with her beautiful and beneficent presence like light.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could have looked at her forever&mdash;half in love, half in awe; but
      she suddenly dwindled down into the little old woman all in gray, and,
      with a malicious twinkle in her eyes, asked for the traveling-cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring it out of the rubbish cupboard, and shake the dust off it, quick!"
      said she to Prince Dolor, who hung his head, rather ashamed. "Spread it
      out on the floor, and wait till the split closes and the edges turn up
      like a rim all round. Then go and open the skylight,&mdash;mind, I say
      OPEN THE SKYLIGHT,&mdash;set yourself down in the middle of it, like a
      frog on a water-lily leaf; say 'Abracadabra, dum dum dum,' and&mdash;see
      what will happen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince burst into a fit of laughing. It all seemed so exceedingly
      silly; he wondered that a wise old woman like his godmother should talk
      such nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stuff-and-nonsense, you mean," said she, answering, to his great alarm,
      his unspoken thoughts. "Did I not tell you some people called me by that
      name? Never mind; it doesn't harm me."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she laughed&mdash;her merry laugh&mdash;as child-like as if she were
      the Prince's age instead of her own, whatever that might be. She certainly
      was a most extraordinary old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me or not, it doesn't matter," said she. "Here is the cloak: when
      you want to go traveling on it, say 'Abracadabra, dum, dum, dum'; when you
      want to come back again, say 'Abracadabra, tum tum ti.' That's all;
      good-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      A puff of most pleasant air passing by him, and making him feel for the
      moment quite strong and well, was all the Prince was conscious of. His
      most extraordinary godmother was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really now, how rosy your Royal Highness' cheeks have grown! You seem to
      have got well already," said the nurse, entering the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I have," replied the Prince very gently&mdash;he felt gently and
      kindly even to his grim nurse. "And now let me have my dinner, and go you
      to your sewing as usual."
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant she was gone, however, taking with her the plates and dishes,
      which for the first time since his illness he had satisfactorily cleared,
      Prince Dolor sprang down from his sofa, and with one or two of his
      frog-like jumps reached the cupboard where he kept his toys, and looked
      everywhere for his traveling-cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! it was not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was ill of the doldrums, his nurse, thinking it a good
      opportunity for putting things to rights, had made a grand clearance of
      all his "rubbish"&mdash;as she considered it: his beloved headless horses,
      broken carts, sheep without feet, and birds without wings&mdash;all the
      treasures of his baby days, which he could not bear to part with. Though
      he seldom played with them now, he liked just to feel they were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all gone and with them the traveling-cloak. He sat down on the
      floor, looking at the empty shelves, so beautifully clean and tidy, then
      burst out sobbing as if his heart would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      But quietly&mdash;always quietly. He never let his nurse hear him cry. She
      only laughed at him, as he felt she would laugh now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it is all my own fault!" he cried. "I ought to have taken better care
      of my godmother's gift. Oh, godmother, forgive me! I'll never be so
      careless again. I don't know what the cloak is exactly, but I am sure it
      is something precious. Help me to find it again. Oh, don't let it be
      stolen from me&mdash;don't, please!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed a silvery voice. "Why, that traveling-cloak is the
      one thing in the world which nobody can steal. It is of no use to anybody
      except the owner. Open your eyes, my Prince, and see what you shall see."
    </p>
    <p>
      His dear old godmother, he thought, and turned eagerly round. But no; he
      only beheld, lying in a corner of the room, all dust and cobwebs, his
      precious traveling-cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor darted toward it, tumbling several times on the way, as he
      often did tumble, poor boy! and pick himself up again, never complaining.
      Snatching it to his breast, he hugged and kissed it, cobwebs and all, as
      if it had been something alive. Then he began unrolling it, wondering each
      minute what would happen. What did happen was so curious that I must leave
      it for another chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      If any reader, big or little, should wonder whether there is a meaning in
      this story deeper than that of an ordinary fairy tale, I will own that
      there is. But I have hidden it so carefully that the smaller people, and
      many larger folk, will never find it out, and meantime the book may be
      read straight on, like "Cinderella," or "Blue-Beard," or "Hop-o'my-Thumb,"
      for what interest it has, or what amusement it may bring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having said this, I return to Prince Dolor, that little lame boy whom many
      may think so exceedingly to be pitied. But if you had seen him as he sat
      patiently untying his wonderful cloak, which was done up in a very tight
      and perplexing parcel, using skillfully his deft little hands, and
      knitting his brows with firm determination, while his eyes glistened with
      pleasure and energy and eager anticipation&mdash;if you had beheld him
      thus, you might have changed your opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we see people suffering or unfortunate, we feel very sorry for them;
      but when we see them bravely bearing their sufferings and making the best
      of their misfortunes, it is quite a different feeling. We respect, we
      admire them. One can respect and admire even a little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Prince Dolor had patiently untied all the knots, a remarkable thing
      happened. The cloak began to undo itself. Slowly unfolding, it laid itself
      down on the carpet, as flat as if it had been ironed; the split joined
      with a little sharp crick-crack, and the rim turned up all round till it
      was breast-high; for meantime the cloak had grown and grown, and become
      quite large enough for one person to sit in it as comfortable as if in a
      boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince watched it rather anxiously; it was such an extraordinary, not
      to say a frightening, thing. However, he was no coward, but a thorough
      boy, who, if he had been like other boys, would doubtless have grown up
      daring and adventurous&mdash;a soldier, a sailor, or the like. As it was,
      he could only show his courage morally, not physically, by being afraid of
      nothing, and by doing boldly all that it was in his narrow powers to do.
      And I am not sure but that in this way he showed more real valor than if
      he had had six pairs of proper legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said to himself: "What a goose I am! As if my dear godmother would ever
      have given me anything to hurt me. Here goes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So, with one of his active leaps, he sprang right into the middle of the
      cloak, where he squatted down, wrapping his arms tight round his knees,
      for they shook a little and his heart beat fast. But there he sat, steady
      and silent, waiting for what might happen next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing did happen, and he began to think nothing would, and to feel
      rather disappointed, when he recollected the words he had been told to
      repeat&mdash;"Abracadabra, dum dum dum!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated them, laughing all the while, they seemed such nonsense. And
      then&mdash;and then&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I don't expect anybody to believe what I am going to relate, though a
      good many wise people have believed a good many sillier things. And as
      seeing's believing, and I never saw it, I cannot be expected implicitly to
      believe it myself, except in a sort of a way; and yet there is truth in it&mdash;for
      some people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloak rose, slowly and steadily, at first only a few inches, then
      gradually higher and higher, till it nearly touched the skylight. Prince
      Dolor's head actually bumped against the glass, or would have done so had
      he not crouched down, crying "Oh, please don't hurt me!" in a most
      melancholy voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he suddenly remembered his godmother's express command&mdash;"Open
      the skylight!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Regaining his courage at once, without a moment's delay he lifted up his
      head and began searching for the bolt&mdash;the cloak meanwhile remaining
      perfectly still, balanced in the air. But the minute the window was
      opened, out it sailed&mdash;right out into the clear, fresh air, with
      nothing between it and the cloudless blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor had never felt any such delicious sensation before. I can
      understand it. Cannot you? Did you never think, in watching the rooks
      going home singly or in pairs, soaring their way across the calm evening
      sky till they vanish like black dots in the misty gray, how pleasant it
      must feel to be up there, quite out of the noise and din of the world,
      able to hear and see everything down below, yet troubled by nothing and
      teased by no one&mdash;all alone, but perfectly content?
    </p>
    <p>
      Something like this was the happiness of the little lame Prince when he
      got out of Hopeless Tower, and found himself for the first time in the
      pure open air, with the sky above him and the earth below.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, there was nothing but earth and sky; no houses, no trees, no rivers,
      mountains, seas&mdash;not a beast on the ground, or a bird in the air. But
      to him even the level plain looked beautiful; and then there was the
      glorious arch of the sky, with a little young moon sitting in the west
      like a baby queen. And the evening breeze was so sweet and fresh&mdash;it
      kissed him like his godmother's kisses; and by and by a few stars came out&mdash;first
      two or three, and then quantities&mdash;quantities! so that when he began
      to count them he was utterly bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, however, the cool breeze had become cold; the mist gathered;
      and as he had, as he said, no outdoor clothes, poor Prince Dolor was not
      very comfortable. The dews fell damp on his curls&mdash;he began to
      shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I had better go home," thought he.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how? For in his excitement the other words which his godmother had
      told him to use had slipped his memory. They were only a little different
      from the first, but in that slight difference all the importance lay. As
      he repeated his "Abracadabra," trying ever so many other syllables after
      it, the cloak only went faster and faster, skimming on through the dusky,
      empty air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor little Prince began to feel frightened. What if his wonderful
      traveling-cloak should keep on thus traveling, perhaps to the world's end,
      carrying with it a poor, tired, hungry boy, who, after all, was beginning
      to think there was something very pleasant in supper and bed!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear godmother," he cried pitifully, "do help me! Tell me just this once
      and I'll never forget again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the words came rushing into his head&mdash;"Abracadabra, tum tum
      ti!" Was that it? Ah! yes&mdash;for the cloak began to turn slowly. He
      repeated the charm again, more distinctly and firmly, when it gave a
      gentle dip, like a nod of satisfaction, and immediately started back, as
      fast as ever, in the direction of the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the skylight, which he found exactly as he had left it, and
      slipped in, cloak and all, as easily as he had got out. He had scarcely
      reached the floor, and was still sitting in the middle of his
      traveling-cloak,&mdash;like a frog on a water-lily leaf, as his godmother
      had expressed it,&mdash;when he heard his nurse's voice outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless us! what has become of your Royal Highness all this time? To sit
      stupidly here at the window till it is quite dark, and leave the skylight
      open, too. Prince! what can you be thinking of? You are the silliest boy I
      ever knew."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I?" said he absently, and never heeding her crossness; for his only
      anxiety was lest she might find out anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have been a very clever person to have done so. The instant
      Prince Dolor got off it, the cloak folded itself up into the tiniest
      possible parcel, tied all its own knots, and rolled itself of its own
      accord into the farthest and darkest corner of the room. If the nurse had
      seen it, which she didn't, she would have taken it for a mere bundle of
      rubbish not worth noticing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shutting the skylight with an angry bang, she brought in the supper and
      lit the candles with her usual unhappy expression of countenance. But
      Prince Dolor hardly saw it; he only saw, hid in the corner where nobody
      else would see it, his wonderful traveling-cloak. And though his supper
      was not particularly nice, he ate it heartily, scarcely hearing a word of
      his nurse's grumbling, which to-night seemed to have taken the place of
      her sullen silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor woman!" he thought, when he paused a minute to listen and look at
      her with those quiet, happy eyes, so like his mother's. "Poor woman! she
      hasn't got a traveling-cloak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he was left alone at last, and crept into his little bed, where
      he lay awake a good while, watching what he called his "sky-garden," all
      planted with stars, like flowers, his chief thought was&mdash;"I must be
      up very early to-morrow morning, and get my lessons done, and then I'll go
      traveling all over the world on my beautiful cloak."
    </p>
    <p>
      So next day he opened his eyes with the sun, and went with a good heart to
      his lessons. They had hitherto been the chief amusement of his dull life;
      now, I am afraid, he found them also a little dull. But he tried to be
      good,&mdash;I don't say Prince Dolor always was good, but he generally
      tried to be,&mdash;and when his mind went wandering after the dark, dusty
      corner where lay his precious treasure, he resolutely called it back
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For," he said, "how ashamed my godmother would be of me if I grew up a
      stupid boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the instant lessons were done, and he was alone in the empty room, he
      crept across the floor, undid the shabby little bundle, his fingers
      trembling with eagerness, climbed on the chair, and thence to the table,
      so as to unbar the skylight,&mdash;he forgot nothing now,&mdash;said his
      magic charm, and was away out of the window, as children say, "in a few
      minutes less than no time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody missed him. He was accustomed to sit so quietly always that his
      nurse, though only in the next room, perceived no difference. And besides,
      she might have gone in and out a dozen times, and it would have been just
      the same; she never could have found out his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For what do you think the clever godmother did? She took a quantity of
      moonshine, or some equally convenient material, and made an image, which
      she set on the window-sill reading, or by the table drawing, where it
      looked so like Prince Dolor that any common observer would never have
      guessed the deception; and even the boy would have been puzzled to know
      which was the image and which was himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this while the happy little fellow was away, floating in the air
      on his magic cloak, and seeing all sorts of wonderful things&mdash;or they
      seemed wonderful to him, who had hitherto seen nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, there were the flowers that grew on the plain, which, whenever the
      cloak came near enough, he strained his eyes to look at; they were very
      tiny, but very beautiful&mdash;white saxifrage, and yellow lotus, and
      ground-thistles, purple and bright, with many others the names of which I
      do not know. No more did Prince Dolor, though he tried to find them out by
      recalling any pictures he had seen of them. But he was too far off; and
      though it was pleasant enough to admire them as brilliant patches of
      color, still he would have liked to examine them all. He was, as a little
      girl I know once said of a playfellow, "a very examining boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder," he thought, "whether I could see better through a pair of
      glasses like those my nurse reads with, and takes such care of. How I
      would take care of them, too, if I only had a pair!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately he felt something queer and hard fixing itself to the bridge
      of his nose. It was a pair of the prettiest gold spectacles ever seen; and
      looking downward, he found that, though ever so high above the ground, he
      could see every minute blade of grass, every tiny bud and flower&mdash;nay,
      even the insects that walked over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, thank you!" he cried, in a gush of gratitude&mdash;to anybody
      or everybody, but especially to his dear godmother, who he felt sure had
      given him this new present. He amused himself with it for ever so long,
      with his chin pressed on the rim of the cloak, gazing down upon the grass,
      every square foot of which was a mine of wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, just to rest his eyes, he turned them up to the sky&mdash;the blue,
      bright, empty sky, which he had looked at so often and seen nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now surely there was something. A long, black, wavy line, moving on in the
      distance, not by chance, as the clouds move apparently, but deliberately,
      as if it were alive. He might have seen it before&mdash;he almost thought
      he had; but then he could not tell what it was. Looking at it through his
      spectacles, he discovered that it really was alive; being a long string of
      birds, flying one after the other, their wings moving steadily and their
      heads pointed in one direction, as steadily as if each were a little ship,
      guided invisibly by an unerring helm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They must be the passage-birds flying seaward!" cried the boy, who had
      read a little about them, and had a great talent for putting two and two
      together and finding out all he could. "Oh, how I should like to see them
      quite close, and to know where they come from and whither they are going!
      How I wish I knew everything in all the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A silly speech for even an "examining" little boy to make; because, as we
      grow older, the more we know the more we find out there is to know. And
      Prince Dolor blushed when he had said it, and hoped nobody had heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently somebody had, however; for the cloak gave a sudden bound
      forward, and presently he found himself high in the air, in the very
      middle of that band of aerial travelers, who had mo magic cloak to travel
      on&mdash;nothing except their wings. Yet there they were, making their
      fearless way through the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor looked at them as one after the other they glided past him;
      and they looked at him&mdash;those pretty swallows, with their changing
      necks and bright eyes&mdash;as if wondering to meet in mid-air such an
      extraordinary sort of bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I wish I were going with you, you lovely creatures! I'm getting so
      tired of this dull plain, and the dreary and lonely tower. I do so want to
      see the world! Pretty swallows, dear swallows! tell me what it looks like&mdash;the
      beautiful, wonderful world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the swallows flew past him&mdash;steadily, slowly pursuing their
      course as if inside each little head had been a mariner's compass, to
      guide them safe over land and sea, direct to the place where they wished
      to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked after them with envy. For a long time he followed with his
      eyes the faint, wavy black line as it floated away, sometimes changing its
      curves a little, but never deviating from its settled course, till it
      vanished entirely out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he settled himself down in the center of the cloak, feeling quite sad
      and lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I'll go home," said he, and repeated his "Abracadabra, tum tum
      ti!" with a rather heavy heart. The more he had, the more he wanted; and
      it is not always one can have everything one wants&mdash;at least, at the
      exact minute one craves for it; not even though one is a prince, and has a
      powerful and beneficent godmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not like to vex her by calling for her and telling her how unhappy
      he was, in spite of all her goodness; so he just kept his trouble to
      himself, went back to his lonely tower, and spent three days in silent
      melancholy, without even attempting another journey on his
      traveling-cloak.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The fourth day it happened that the deaf-mute paid his accustomed visit,
      after which Prince Dolor's spirits rose. They always did when he got the
      new books which, just to relieve his conscience, the King of Nomansland
      regularly sent to his nephew; with many new toys also, though the latter
      were disregarded now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toys, indeed! when I'm a big boy," said the Prince, with disdain, and
      would scarcely condescend to mount a rocking-horse which had come, somehow
      or other,&mdash;I can't be expected to explain things very exactly,&mdash;packed
      on the back of the other, the great black horse, which stood and fed
      contentedly at the bottom of the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor leaned over and looked at it, and thought how grand it must
      be to get upon its back&mdash;this grand live steed&mdash;and ride away,
      like the pictures of knights.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose I was a knight," he said to himself; "then I should be obliged to
      ride out and see the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he kept all these thoughts to himself, and just sat still, devouring
      his new books till he had come to the end of them all. It was a repast not
      unlike the Barmecide's feast which you read of in the "Arabian Nights,"
      which consisted of very elegant but empty dishes, or that supper of Sancho
      Panza in "Don Quixote," where, the minute the smoking dishes came on the
      table, the physician waved his hand and they were all taken away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus almost all the ordinary delights of boy-life had been taken away
      from, or rather never given to this poor little prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder," he would sometimes think&mdash;"I wonder what it feels like to
      be on the back of a horse, galloping away, or holding the reins in a
      carriage, and tearing across the country, or jumping a ditch, or running a
      race, such as I read of or see in pictures. What a lot of things there are
      that I should like to do! But first I should like to go and see the world.
      I'll try."
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently it was his godmother's plan always to let him try, and try
      hard, before he gained anything. This day the knots that tied up his
      traveling-cloak were more than usually troublesome, and he was a full
      half-hour before he got out into the open air, and found himself floating
      merrily over the top of the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto, in all his journeys, he had never let himself go out of sight of
      home, for the dreary building, after all, was home&mdash;he remembered no
      other; but now he felt sick of the very look of his tower, with its round
      smooth walls and level battlements.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Off we go!" cried he, when the cloak stirred itself with a slight, slow
      motion, as if waiting his orders. "Anywhere anywhere, so that I am away
      from here, and out into the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the cloak, as if seized suddenly with a new idea, bounded
      forward and went skimming through the air, faster than the very fastest
      railway train.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gee-up! gee-up!" cried Prince Dolor in great excitement. "This is as good
      as riding a race."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he patted the cloak as if it had been a horse&mdash;that is, in the
      way he supposed horses ought to be patted&mdash;and tossed his head back
      to meet the fresh breeze, and pulled his coat collar up and his hat down
      as he felt the wind grow keener and colder&mdash;colder than anything he
      had ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does it matter, though?" said he. "I'm a boy, and boys ought not to
      mind anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, for all his good-will, by and by, he began to shiver exceedingly;
      also, he had come away without his dinner, and he grew frightfully hungry.
      And to add to everything, the sunshiny day changed into rain, and being
      high up, in the very midst of the clouds, he got soaked through and
      through in a very few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I turn back?" meditated he. "Suppose I say 'Abracadabra?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he stopped, for already the cloak gave an obedient lurch, as if it
      were expecting to be sent home immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;I can't&mdash;I can't go back! I must go forward and see the
      world. But oh! if I had but the shabbiest old rug to shelter me from the
      rain, or the driest morsel of bread and cheese, just to keep me from
      starving! Still, I don't much mind; I'm a prince, and ought to be able to
      stand anything. Hold on, cloak, we'll make the best of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a most curious circumstance, but no sooner had he said this than he
      felt stealing over his knees something warm and soft; in fact, a most
      beautiful bearskin, which folded itself round him quite naturally, and
      cuddled him up as closely as if he had been the cub of the kind old
      mother-bear that once owned it. Then feeling in his pocket, which suddenly
      stuck out in a marvelous way, he found, not exactly bread and cheese, nor
      even sandwiches, but a packet of the most delicious food he had ever
      tasted. It was not meat, nor pudding, but a combination of both, and it
      served him excellently for both. He ate his dinner with the greatest gusto
      imaginable, till he grew so thirsty he did not know what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't I have just one drop of water, if it didn't trouble you too
      much, kindest of godmothers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For he really thought this want was beyond her power to supply. All the
      water which supplied Hopeless Tower was pumped up with difficulty from a
      deep artesian well&mdash;there were such things known in Nomansland&mdash;which
      had been made at the foot of it. But around, for miles upon miles, the
      desolate plain was perfectly dry. And above it, high in the air, how could
      he expect to find a well, or to get even a drop of water?
    </p>
    <p>
      He forgot one thing&mdash;the rain. While he spoke, it came on in another
      wild burst, as if the clouds had poured themselves out in a passion of
      crying, wetting him certainly, but leaving behind, in a large glass vessel
      which he had never noticed before, enough water to quench the thirst of
      two or three boys at least. And it was so fresh, so pure&mdash;as water
      from the clouds always is when it does not catch the soot from city
      chimneys and other defilements&mdash;that he drank it, every drop, with
      the greatest delight and content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, as soon as it was empty the rain filled it again, so that he was
      able to wash his face and hands and refresh himself exceedingly. Then the
      sun came out and dried him in no time. After that he curled himself up
      under the bear-skin rug, and though he determined to be the most
      wide-awake boy imaginable, being so exceedingly snug and warm and
      comfortable, Prince Dolor condescended to shut his eyes just for one
      minute. The next minute he was sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he awoke, he found himself floating over a country quite unlike
      anything he had ever seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was nothing but what most of you children see every day and never
      notice it&mdash;a pretty country landscape, like England, Scotland,
      France, or any other land you choose to name. It had no particular
      features&mdash;nothing in it grand or lovely&mdash;was simply pretty,
      nothing more; yet to Prince Dolor, who had never gone beyond his lonely
      tower and level plain, it appeared the most charming sight imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, there was a river. It came tumbling down the hillside, frothing and
      foaming, playing at hide-and-seek among the rocks, then bursting out in
      noisy fun like a child, to bury itself in deep, still pools. Afterward it
      went steadily on for a while, like a good grown-up person, till it came to
      another big rock, where it misbehaved itself extremely. It turned into a
      cataract, and went tumbling over and over, after a fashion that made the
      prince&mdash;who had never seen water before, except in his bath or his
      drinking-cup&mdash;clap his hands with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so active, so alive! I like things active and alive!" cried he, and
      watched it shimmering and dancing, whirling and leaping, till, after a few
      windings and vagaries, it settled into a respectable stream. After that it
      went along, deep and quiet, but flowing steadily on, till it reached a
      large lake, into which it slipped and so ended its course.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this the boy saw, either with his own naked eye or through his gold
      spectacles. He saw also as in a picture, beautiful but silent, many other
      things which struck him with wonder, especially a grove of trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only think, to have lived to his age (which he himself did not know, as he
      did not know his own birthday) and never to have seen trees! As he floated
      over these oaks, they seemed to him&mdash;trunk, branches, and leaves&mdash;the
      most curious sight imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could only get nearer, so as to touch them," said he, and
      immediately the obedient cloak ducked down; Prince Dolor made a snatch at
      the topmost twig of the tallest tree, and caught a bunch of leaves in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a bunch of green leaves&mdash;such as we see in myriads; watching
      them bud, grow, fall, and then kicking them along on the ground as if they
      were worth nothing. Yet how wonderful they are&mdash;every one of them a
      little different. I don't suppose you could ever find two leaves exactly
      alike in form, color, and size&mdash;no more than you could find two faces
      alike, or two characters exactly the same. The plan of this world is
      infinite similarity and yet infinite variety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor examined his leaves with the greatest curiosity&mdash;and
      also a little caterpillar that he found walking over one of them. He
      coaxed it to take an additional walk over his finger, which it did with
      the greatest dignity and decorum, as if it, Mr. Caterpillar, were the most
      important individual in existence. It amused him for a long time; and when
      a sudden gust of wind blew it overboard, leaves and all, he felt quite
      disconsolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still there must be many live creatures in the world besides
      caterpillars. I should like to see a few of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloak gave a little dip down, as if to say "All right, my Prince," and
      bore him across the oak forest to a long fertile valley&mdash;called in
      Scotland a strath and in England a weald, but what they call it in the
      tongue of Nomansland I do not know. It was made up of cornfields,
      pasturefields, lanes, hedges, brooks, and ponds. Also, in it were what the
      prince desired to see&mdash;a quantity of living creatures, wild and tame.
      Cows and horses, lambs and sheep, fed in the meadows; pigs and fowls
      walked about the farm-yards; and in lonelier places hares scudded, rabbits
      burrowed, and pheasants and partridges, with many other smaller birds,
      inhabited the fields and woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through his wonderful spectacles the Prince could see everything; but, as
      I said, it was a silent picture; he was too high up to catch anything
      except a faint murmur, which only aroused his anxiety to hear more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have as good as two pairs of eyes," he thought. "I wonder if my
      godmother would give me a second pair of ears."
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he spoken than he found lying on his lap the most curious
      little parcel, all done up in silvery paper. And it contained&mdash;what
      do you think? Actually a pair of silver ears, which, when he tried them
      on, fitted so exactly over his own that he hardly felt them, except for
      the difference they made in his hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something which we listen to daily and never notice. I mean the
      sounds of the visible world, animate and inanimate. Winds blowing, waters
      flowing, trees stirring, insects whirring (dear me! I am quite
      unconsciously writing rhyme), with the various cries of birds and beasts,&mdash;lowing
      cattle, bleating sheep, grunting pigs, and cackling hens,&mdash;all the
      infinite discords that somehow or other make a beautiful harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hear this, and are so accustomed to it that we think nothing of it; but
      Prince Dolor, who had lived all his days in the dead silence of Hopeless
      Tower, heard it for the first time. And oh! if you had seen his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened, listened, as if he could never have done listening. And he
      looked and looked, as if he could not gaze enough. Above all, the motion
      of the animals delighted him: cows walking, horses galloping, little lambs
      and calves running races across the meadows, were such a treat for him to
      watch&mdash;he that was always so quiet. But, these creatures having four
      legs, and he only two, the difference did not strike him painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, by and by, after the fashion of children,&mdash;and I fear, of many
      big people too,&mdash;he began to want something more than he had,
      something fresh and new.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Godmother," he said, having now begun to believe that, whether he saw her
      or not, he could always speak to her with full confidence that she would
      hear him&mdash;"Godmother, all these creatures I like exceedingly; but I
      should like better to see a creature like myself. Couldn't you show me
      just one little boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sigh behind him,&mdash;it might have been only the wind,&mdash;and
      the cloak remained so long balanced motionless in air that he was half
      afraid his godmother had forgotten him, or was offended with him for
      asking too much. Suddenly a shrill whistle startled him, even through his
      silver ears, and looking downward, he saw start up from behind a bush on a
      common, something&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither a sheep nor a horse nor a cow&mdash;nothing upon four legs. This
      creature had only two; but they were long, straight, and strong. And it
      had a lithe, active body, and a curly head of black hair set upon its
      shoulders. It was a boy, a shepherd-boy, about the Prince's own age&mdash;but,
      oh! so different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that he was an ugly boy&mdash;though his face was almost as red as his
      hands, and his shaggy hair matted like the backs of his own sheep. He was
      rather a nice-looking lad; and seemed so bright and healthy and
      good-tempered&mdash;"jolly" would be the word, only I am not sure if they
      have such a one in the elegant language of Nomansland&mdash;that the
      little Prince watched him with great admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might he come and play with me? I would drop down to the ground to him,
      or fetch him up to me here. Oh, how nice it would be if I only had a
      little boy to play with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cloak, usually so obedient to his wishes, disobeyed him now. There
      were evidently some things which his godmother either could not or would
      not give. The cloak hung stationary, high in air, never attempting to
      descend. The shepherd-lad evidently took it for a large bird, and, shading
      his eyes, looked up at it, making the Prince's heart beat fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, nothing ensued. The boy turned round, with a long, loud whistle&mdash;seemingly
      his usual and only way of expressing his feelings. He could not make the
      thing out exactly&mdash;it was a rather mysterious affair, but it did not
      trouble him much&mdash;he was not an "examining" boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, stretching himself, for he had been evidently half asleep, he began
      flopping his shoulders with his arms to wake and warm himself; while his
      dog, a rough collie, who had been guarding the sheep meanwhile, began to
      jump upon him, barking with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Down, Snap, down: Stop that, or I'll thrash you," the Prince heard him
      say; though with such a rough, hard voice and queer pronunciation that it
      was difficult to make the words out. "Hollo! Let's warm ourselves by a
      race."
    </p>
    <p>
      They started off together, boy and dog&mdash;barking and shouting, till it
      was doubtful which made the more noise or ran the faster. A regular
      steeplechase it was: first across the level common, greatly disturbing the
      quiet sheep; and then tearing away across country, scrambling through
      hedges and leaping ditches, and tumbling up and down over plowed fields.
      They did not seem to have anything to run for&mdash;but as if they did it,
      both of them, for the mere pleasure of motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what a pleasure that seemed! To the dog of course, but scarcely less
      so to the boy. How he skimmed along over the ground&mdash;his cheeks
      glowing, and his hair flying, and his legs&mdash;oh, what a pair of legs
      he had!
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor watched him with great intentness, and in a state of
      excitement almost equal to that of the runner himself&mdash;for a while.
      Then the sweet, pale face grew a trifle paler, the lips began to quiver,
      and the eyes to fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How nice it must be to run like that!" he said softly, thinking that
      never&mdash;no, never in this world&mdash;would he be able to do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he understood what his godmother had meant when she gave him his
      traveling-cloak, and why he had heard that sigh&mdash;he was sure it was
      hers&mdash;when he had asked to see "just one little boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I had rather not look at him again," said the poor little Prince,
      drawing himself back into the center of his cloak, and resuming his
      favorite posture, sitting like a Turk, with his arms wrapped round his
      feeble, useless legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're no good to me," he said, patting them mournfully. "You never will
      be any good to me. I wonder why I had you at all. I wonder why I was born
      at all, since I was not to grow up like other boys. Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A question so strange, so sad, yet so often occurring in some form or
      other in this world&mdash;as you will find, my children, when you are
      older&mdash;that even if he had put it to his mother she could only have
      answered it, as we have to answer many as difficult things, by simply
      saying, "I don't know." There is much that we do not know and cannot
      understand&mdash;we big folks no more than you little ones. We have to
      accept it all just as you have to accept anything which your parents may
      tell you, even though you don't as yet see the reason of it. You may
      sometime, if you do exactly as they tell you, and are content to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor sat a good while thus, or it appeared to him a good while, so
      many thoughts came and went through his poor young mind&mdash;thoughts of
      great bitterness, which, little though he was, seemed to make him grow
      years older in a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he fancied the cloak began to rock gently to and fro, with a soothing
      kind of motion, as if he were in somebody's arms: somebody who did not
      speak, but loved him and comforted him without need of words; not by
      deceiving him with false encouragement or hope, but by making him see the
      plain, hard truth in all its hardness, and thus letting him quietly face
      it, till it grew softened down, and did not seem nearly so dreadful after
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the dreary silence and blankness, for he had placed himself so
      that he could see nothing but the sky, and had taken off his silver ears
      as well as his gold spectacles&mdash;what was the use of either when he
      had no legs with which to walk or run?&mdash;up from below there rose a
      delicious sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have heard it hundreds of times, my children, and so have I. When I
      was a child I thought there was nothing so sweet; and I think so still. It
      was just the song of a skylark, mounting higher and higher from the
      ground, till it came so close that Prince Dolor could distinguish his
      quivering wings and tiny body, almost too tiny to contain such a gush of
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you beautiful, beautiful bird!" cried he; "I should dearly like to
      take you in and cuddle you. That is, if I could&mdash;if I dared."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he hesitated. The little brown creature with its loud heavenly voice
      almost made him afraid. Nevertheless, it also made him happy; and he
      watched and listened&mdash;so absorbed that he forgot all regret and pain,
      forgot everything in the world except the little lark.
    </p>
    <p>
      It soared and soared, and he was just wondering if it would soar out of
      sight, and what in the world he should do when it was gone, when it
      suddenly closed its wings, as larks do when they mean to drop to the
      ground. But, instead of dropping to the ground, it dropped right into the
      little boy's breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      What felicity! If it would only stay! A tiny, soft thing to fondle and
      kiss, to sing to him all day long, and be his playfellow and companion,
      tame and tender, while to the rest of the world it was a wild bird of the
      air. What a pride, what a delight! To have something that nobody else had&mdash;something
      all his own. As the traveling-cloak traveled on, he little heeded where,
      and the lark still stayed, nestled down in his bosom, hopped from his hand
      to his shoulder, and kissed him with its dainty beak, as if it loved him,
      Prince Dolor forgot all his grief, and was entirely happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he got in sight of Hopeless Tower a painful thought struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My pretty bird, what am I to do with you? If I take you into my room and
      shut you up there, you, a wild skylark of the air, what will become of
      you? I am used to this, but you are not. You will be so miserable; and
      suppose my nurse should find you&mdash;she who can't bear the sound of
      singing? Besides, I remember her once telling me that the nicest thing she
      ever ate in her life was lark pie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The little boy shivered all over at the thought. And, though the merry
      lark immediately broke into the loudest carol, as if saying derisively
      that he defied anybody to eat him, still, Prince Dolor was very uneasy. In
      another minute he had made up his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my bird, nothing so dreadful shall happen to you if I can help it; I
      would rather do without you altogether. Yes, I'll try. Fly away, my
      darling, my beautiful! Good-by, my merry, merry bird."
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening his two caressing hands, in which, as if for protection, he had
      folded it, he let the lark go. It lingered a minute, perching on the rim
      of the cloak, and looking at him with eyes of almost human tenderness;
      then away it flew, far up into the blue sky. It was only a bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      But some time after, when Prince Dolor had eaten his supper&mdash;somewhat
      drearily, except for the thought that he could not possibly sup off lark
      pie now&mdash;and gone quietly to bed, the old familiar little bed, where
      he was accustomed to sleep, or lie awake contentedly thinking&mdash;suddenly
      he heard outside the window a little faint carol&mdash;faint but cheerful&mdash;cheerful
      even though it was the middle of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dear little lark! it had not flown away, after all. And it was truly
      the most extraordinary bird, for, unlike ordinary larks, it kept hovering
      about the tower in the silence and darkness of the night, outside the
      window or over the roof. Whenever he listened for a moment, he heard it
      singing still.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to sleep as happy as a king.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Happy as a king." How far kings are happy I cannot say, no more than
      could Prince Dolor, though he had once been a king himself. But he
      remembered nothing about it, and there was nobody to tell him, except his
      nurse, who had been forbidden upon pain of death to let him know anything
      about his dead parents, or the king his uncle, or indeed any part of his
      own history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he speculated about himself, whether he had had a father and
      mother as other little boys had what they had been like, and why he had
      never seen them. But, knowing nothing about them, he did not miss them&mdash;only
      once or twice, reading pretty stories about little children and their
      mothers, who helped them when they were in difficulty and comforted them
      when they were sick, he feeling ill and dull and lonely, wondered what had
      become of his mother and why she never came to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in his history lessons, of course he read about kings and princes,
      and the governments of different countries, and the events that happened
      there. And though he but faintly took in all this, still he did take it in
      a little, and worried his young brain about it, and perplexed his nurse
      with questions, to which she returned sharp and mysterious answers, which
      only set him thinking the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had plenty of time for thinking. After his last journey in the
      traveling-cloak, the journey which had given him so much pain, his desire
      to see the world somehow faded away. He contented himself with reading his
      books, and looking out of the tower windows, and listening to his beloved
      little lark, which had come home with him that day, and never left him
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, it kept out of the way; and though his nurse sometimes dimly heard
      it, and said "What is that horrid noise outside?" she never got the
      faintest chance of making it into a lark pie. Prince Dolor had his pet all
      to himself, and though he seldom saw it, he knew it was near him, and he
      caught continually, at odd hours of the day, and even in the night,
      fragments of its delicious song.
    </p>
    <p>
      All during the winter&mdash;so far as there ever was any difference
      between summer and winter in Hopeless Tower&mdash;the little bird cheered
      and amused him. He scarcely needed anything more&mdash;not even his
      traveling-cloak, which lay bundled up unnoticed in a corner, tied up in
      its innumerable knots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did his godmother come near him. It seemed as if she had given these
      treasures and left him alone&mdash;to use them or lose them, apply them or
      misapply them, according to his own choice. That is all we can do with
      children when they grow into big children old enough to distinguish
      between right and wrong, and too old to be forced to do either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor was now quite a big boy. Not tall&mdash;alas! he never could
      be that, with his poor little shrunken legs, which were of no use, only an
      encumbrance. But he was stout and strong, with great sturdy shoulders, and
      muscular arms, upon which he could swing himself about almost like a
      monkey. As if in compensation for his useless lower limbs, Nature had
      given to these extra strength and activity. His face, too, was very
      handsome; thinner, firmer, more manly; but still the sweet face of his
      childhood&mdash;his mother's own face.
    </p>
    <p>
      How his mother would have liked to look at him! Perhaps she did&mdash;who
      knows?
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was not a stupid boy either. He could learn almost anything he
      chose&mdash;and he did choose, which was more than half the battle. He
      never gave up his lessons till he had learned them all&mdash;never thought
      it a punishment that he had to work at them, and that they cost him a deal
      of trouble sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," thought he, "men work, and it must be so grand to be a man&mdash;a
      prince too; and I fancy princes work harder than anybody&mdash;except
      kings. The princes I read about generally turn into kings. I wonder"&mdash;the
      boy was always wondering&mdash;"Nurse,"&mdash;and one day he startled her
      with a sudden question,&mdash;"tell me&mdash;shall I ever be a king?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman stood, perplexed beyond expression. So long a time had passed by
      since her crime&mdash;if it were a crime&mdash;and her sentence, that she
      now seldom thought of either. Even her punishment&mdash;to be shut up for
      life in Hopeless Tower&mdash;she had gradually got used to. Used also to
      the little lame Prince, her charge&mdash;whom at first she had hated,
      though she carefully did everything to keep him alive, since upon him her
      own life hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      But latterly she had ceased to hate him, and, in a sort of way, almost
      loved him&mdash;at least, enough to be sorry for him&mdash;an innocent
      child, imprisoned here till he grew into an old man, and became a dull,
      worn-out creature like herself. Sometimes, watching him, she felt more
      sorry for him than even for herself; and then, seeing she looked a less
      miserable and ugly woman, he did not shrink from her as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not now. "Nurse&mdash;dear nurse," said he, "I don't mean to vex
      you, but tell me what is a king? shall I ever be one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      When she began to think less of herself and more of the child, the woman's
      courage increased. The idea came to her&mdash;what harm would it be, even
      if he did know his own history? Perhaps he ought to know it&mdash;for
      there had been various ups and downs, usurpations, revolutions, and
      restorations in Nomansland, as in most other countries. Something might
      happen&mdash;who could tell? Changes might occur. Possibly a crown would
      even yet be set upon those pretty, fair curls&mdash;which she began to
      think prettier than ever when she saw the imaginary coronet upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down, considering whether her oath, never to "say a word" to
      Prince Dolor about himself, would be broken if she were to take a pencil
      and write what was to be told. A mere quibble&mdash;a mean, miserable
      quibble. But then she was a miserable woman, more to be pitied than
      scorned.
    </p>
    <p>
      After long doubt, and with great trepidation, she put her fingers to her
      lips, and taking the Prince's slate&mdash;with the sponge tied to it,
      ready to rub out the writing in a minute&mdash;she wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a king."
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor started. His face grew pale, and then flushed all over; he
      held himself erect. Lame as he was, anybody could see he was born to be a
      king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" said the nurse, as he was beginning to speak. And then, terribly
      frightened all the while,&mdash;people who have done wrong always are
      frightened,&mdash;she wrote down in a few hurried sentences his history.
      How his parents had died&mdash;his uncle had usurped his throne, and sent
      him to end his days in this lonely tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, too," added she, bursting into tears. "Unless, indeed, you could get
      out into the world, and fight for your rights like a man. And fight for me
      also, my Prince, that I may not die in this desolate place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor old nurse!" said the boy compassionately. For somehow, boy as he
      was, when he heard he was born to be a king, he felt like a man&mdash;like
      a king&mdash;who could afford to be tender because he was strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      He scarcely slept that night, and even though he heard his little lark
      singing in the sunrise, he barely listened to it. Things more serious and
      important had taken possession of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose," thought he, "I were to do as she says, and go out in the world,
      no matter how it hurts me&mdash;the world of people, active people, as
      that boy I saw. They might only laugh at me&mdash;poor helpless creature
      that I am; but still I might show them I could do something. At any rate,
      I might go and see if there were anything for me to do. Godmother, help
      me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so long since he had asked her help that he was hardly surprised
      when he got no answer&mdash;only the little lark outside the window sang
      louder and louder, and the sun rose, flooding the room with light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor sprang out of bed, and began dressing himself, which was hard
      work, for he was not used to it&mdash;he had always been accustomed to
      depend upon his nurse for everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I must now learn to be independent," thought he. "Fancy a king being
      dressed like a baby!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So he did the best he could,&mdash;awkwardly but cheerily,&mdash;and then
      he leaped to the corner where lay his traveling-cloak, untied it as
      before, and watched it unrolling itself&mdash;which it did rapidly, with a
      hearty good-will, as if quite tired of idleness. So was Prince Dolor&mdash;or
      felt as if he were. He jumped into the middle of it, said his charm, and
      was out through the skylight immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by, pretty lark!" he shouted, as he passed it on the wing, still
      warbling its carol to the newly risen sun. "You have been my pleasure, my
      delight; now I must go and work. Sing to old nurse till I come back again.
      Perhaps she'll hear you&mdash;perhaps she won't&mdash;but it will do her
      good all the same. Good-by!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as the cloak hung irresolute in air, he suddenly remembered that he
      had not determined where to go&mdash;indeed, he did not know, and there
      was nobody to tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Godmother," he cried, in much perplexity, "you know what I want,&mdash;at
      least, I hope you do, for I hardly do myself&mdash;take me where I ought
      to go; show me whatever I ought to see&mdash;never mind what I like to
      see," as a sudden idea came into his mind that he might see many painful
      and disagreeable things. But this journey was not for pleasure as before.
      He was not a baby now, to do nothing but play&mdash;big boys do not always
      play. Nor men neither&mdash;they work. Thus much Prince Dolor knew&mdash;though
      very little more.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the cloak started off, traveling faster than he had ever known it to
      do,&mdash;through sky-land and cloud land, over freezing mountain-tops,
      and desolate stretches of forest, and smiling cultivated plains, and great
      lakes that seemed to him almost as shoreless as the sea,&mdash;he was
      often rather frightened. But he crouched down, silent and quiet; what was
      the use of making a fuss? and, wrapping himself up in his bear-skin,
      waited for what was to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some time he heard a murmur in the distance, increasing more and
      more till it grew like the hum of a gigantic hive of bees. And, stretching
      his chin over the rim of his cloak, Prince Dolor saw&mdash;far, far below
      him, yet, with his gold spectacles and silver ears on, he could distinctly
      hear and see&mdash;what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of us have some time or other visited a great metropolis&mdash;have
      wandered through its network of streets&mdash;lost ourselves in its crowds
      of people&mdash;looked up at its tall rows of houses, its grand public
      buildings, churches, and squares. Also, perhaps, we have peeped into its
      miserable little back alleys, where dirty children play in gutters all day
      and half the night&mdash;even young boys go about picking pockets, with
      nobody to tell them it is wrong except the policeman, and he simply takes
      them off to prison. And all this wretchedness is close behind the grandeur&mdash;like
      the two sides of the leaf of a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      An awful sight is a large city, seen any how from any where. But, suppose
      you were to see it from the upper air, where, with your eyes and ears
      open, you could take in everything at once? What would it look like? How
      would you feel about it? I hardly know myself. Do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor had need to be a king&mdash;that is, a boy with a kingly
      nature&mdash;to be able to stand such a sight without being utterly
      overcome. But he was very much bewildered&mdash;as bewildered as a blind
      person who is suddenly made to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed down on the city below him, and then put his hand over his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't bear to look at it, it is so beautiful&mdash;so dreadful. And I
      don't understand it&mdash;not one bit. There is nobody to tell me about
      it. I wish I had somebody to speak to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you? Then pray speak to me. I was always considered good at
      conversation."
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice that squeaked out this reply was an excellent imitation of the
      human one, though it came only from a bird. No lark this time, however,
      but a great black and white creature that flew into the cloak, and began
      walking round and round on the edge of it with a dignified stride, one
      foot before the other, like any unfeathered biped you could name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't the honor of your acquaintance, sir," said the boy politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma'am, if you please. I am a mother bird, and my name is Mag, and I shall
      be happy to tell you everything you want to know. For I know a great deal;
      and I enjoy talking. My family is of great antiquity; we have built in
      this palace for hundreds&mdash;that is to say, dozens of years. I am
      intimately acquainted with the king, the queen, and the little princes and
      princesses&mdash;also the maids of honor, and all the inhabitants of the
      city. I talk a good deal, but I always talk sense, and I daresay I should
      be exceedingly useful to a poor little ignorant boy like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a prince," said the other gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. And I am a magpie. You will find me a most respectable bird."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no doubt of it," was the polite answer&mdash;though he thought in
      his own mind that Mag must have a very good opinion of herself. But she
      was a lady and a stranger, so of course he was civil to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She settled herself at his elbow, and began to chatter away, pointing out
      with one skinny claw, while she balanced herself on the other, every
      object of interest, evidently believing, as no doubt all its inhabitants
      did, that there was no capital in the world like the great metropolis of
      Nomansland.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not seen it, and therefore cannot describe it, so we will just take
      it upon trust, and suppose it to be, like every other fine city, the
      finest city that ever was built. Mag said so&mdash;and of course she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, there were a few things in it which surprised Prince Dolor&mdash;and,
      as he had said, he could not understand them at all. One half the people
      seemed so happy and busy&mdash;hurrying up and down the full streets, or
      driving lazily along the parks in their grand carriages, while the other
      half were so wretched and miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't the world be made a little more level? I would try to do it if I
      were a king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you're not the king: only a little goose of a boy," returned the
      magpie loftily. "And I'm here not to explain things, only to show them.
      Shall I show you the royal palace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very magnificent palace. It had terraces and gardens, battlements
      and towers. It extended over acres of ground, and had in it rooms enough
      to accommodate half the city. Its windows looked in all directions, but
      none of them had any particular view&mdash;except a small one, high up
      toward the roof, which looked out on the Beautiful Mountains. But since
      the queen died there it had been closed, boarded up, indeed, the magpie
      said. It was so little and inconvenient that nobody cared to live in it.
      Besides, the lower apartments, which had no view, were magnificent&mdash;worthy
      of being inhabited by the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to see the king," said Prince Dolor.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      What, I wonder, would be people's idea of a king? What was Prince Dolor's?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps a very splendid personage, with a crown on his head and a scepter
      in his hand, sitting on a throne and judging the people. Always doing
      right, and never wrong&mdash;"The king can do no wrong" was a law laid
      down in olden times. Never cross, or tired, or sick, or suffering;
      perfectly handsome and well dressed, calm and good-tempered, ready to see
      and hear everybody, and discourteous to nobody; all things always going
      well with him, and nothing unpleasant ever happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, probably, was what Prince Dolor expected to see. And what did he
      see? But I must tell you how he saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said the magpie, "no levee to-day. The King is ill, though his
      Majesty does not wish it to be generally known&mdash;it would be so very
      inconvenient. He can't see you, but perhaps you might like to go and take
      a look at him in a way I often do? It is so very amusing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Amusing, indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince was just now too much excited to talk much. Was he not going to
      see the king his uncle, who had succeeded his father and dethroned
      himself; had stepped into all the pleasant things that he, Prince Dolor,
      ought to have had, and shut him up in a desolate tower? What was he like,
      this great, bad, clever man? Had he got all the things he wanted, which
      another ought to have had? And did he enjoy them?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody knows," answered the magpie, just as if she had been sitting
      inside the prince's heart, instead of on the top of his shoulder. "He is a
      king, and that's enough. For the rest nobody knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, Mag flew down on to the palace roof, where the cloak had
      rested, settling down between the great stacks of chimneys as comfortably
      as if on the ground. She pecked at the tiles with her beak&mdash;truly she
      was a wonderful bird&mdash;and immediately a little hole opened, a sort of
      door, through which could be seen distinctly the chamber below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now look in, my Prince. Make haste, for I must soon shut it up again."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boy hesitated. "Isn't it rude?&mdash;won't they think us
      intruding?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear no! there's a hole like this in every palace; dozens of holes,
      indeed. Everybody knows it, but nobody speaks of it. Intrusion! Why,
      though the royal family are supposed to live shut up behind stone walls
      ever so thick, all the world knows that they live in a glass house where
      everybody can see them and throw a stone at them. Now pop down on your
      knees, and take a peep at his Majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      His Majesty!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince gazed eagerly down into a large room, the largest room he had
      ever beheld, with furniture and hangings grander than anything he could
      have ever imagined. A stray sunbeam, coming through a crevice of the
      darkened windows, struck across the carpet, and it was the loveliest
      carpet ever woven&mdash;just like a bed of flowers to walk over; only
      nobody walked over it, the room being perfectly empty and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the King?" asked the puzzled boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There," said Mag, pointing with one wrinkled claw to a magnificent bed,
      large enough to contain six people. In the center of it, just visible
      under the silken counterpane,&mdash;quite straight and still,&mdash;with
      its head on the lace pillow, lay a small figure, something like wax-work,
      fast asleep&mdash;very fast asleep! There was a number of sparkling rings
      on the tiny yellow hands, that were curled a little, helplessly, like a
      baby's, outside the coverlet; the eyes were shut, the nose looked sharp
      and thin, and the long gray beard hid the mouth and lay over the breast. A
      sight not ugly nor frightening, only solemn and quiet. And so very silent&mdash;two
      little flies buzzing about the curtains of the bed being the only audible
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that the King?" whispered Prince Dolor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied the bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been angry&mdash;furiously angry&mdash;ever since he knew how his
      uncle had taken the crown, and sent him, a poor little helpless child, to
      be shut up for life, just as if he had been dead. Many times the boy had
      felt as if, king as he was, he should like to strike him, this great,
      strong, wicked man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, you might as well have struck a baby! How helpless he lay, with his
      eyes shut, and his idle hands folded: they had no more work to do, bad or
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter with him?" asked the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is dead," said the Magpie, with a croak.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, there was not the least use in being angry with him now. On the
      contrary, the Prince felt almost sorry for him, except that he looked so
      peaceful with all his cares at rest. And this was being dead? So even
      kings died?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, he hadn't an easy life, folk say, for all his grandeur.
      Perhaps he is glad it is over. Good-by, your Majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      With another cheerful tap of her beak, Mistress Mag shut down the little
      door in the tiles, and Prince Dolor's first and last sight of his uncle
      was ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat in the center of his traveling-cloak, silent and thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall we do now?" said the magpie. "There's nothing much more to be
      done with his majesty, except a fine funeral, which I shall certainly go
      and see. All the world will. He interested the world exceedingly when he
      was alive, and he ought to do it now he's dead&mdash;just once more. And
      since he can't hear me, I may as well say that, on the whole, his majesty
      is much better dead than alive&mdash;if we can only get somebody in his
      place. There'll be such a row in the city presently. Suppose we float up
      again and see it all&mdash;at a safe distance, though. It will be such
      fun!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will be fun?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A revolution."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether anybody except a magpie would have called it "fun" I don't know,
      but it certainly was a remarkable scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the cathedral bell began to toll and the minute-guns to fire,
      announcing to the kingdom that it was without a king, the people gathered
      in crowds, stopping at street corners to talk together. The murmur now and
      then rose into a shout, and the shout into a roar. When Prince Dolor,
      quietly floating in upper air, caught the sound of their different and
      opposite cries, it seemed to him as if the whole city had gone mad
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Long live the king!" "The king is dead&mdash;down with the king!" "Down
      with the crown, and the king too!" "Hurrah for the republic!" "Hurrah for
      no government at all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the shouts which traveled up to the traveling-cloak. And then
      began&mdash;oh, what a scene!
    </p>
    <p>
      When you children are grown men and women&mdash;or before&mdash;you will
      hear and read in books about what are called revolutions&mdash;earnestly I
      trust that neither I nor you may ever see one. But they have happened, and
      may happen again, in other countries besides Nomansland, when wicked kings
      have helped to make their people wicked too, or out of an unrighteous
      nation have sprung rulers equally bad; or, without either of these causes,
      when a restless country has fancied any change better than no change at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, I don't like changes, unless pretty sure that they are for good.
      And how good can come out of absolute evil&mdash;the horrible evil that
      went on this night under Prince Dolor's very eyes&mdash;soldiers shooting
      down people by hundreds in the streets, scaffolds erected, and heads
      dropping off&mdash;houses burned, and women and children murdered&mdash;this
      is more than I can understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all these things you will find in history, my children, and must by
      and by judge for yourselves the right and wrong of them, as far as anybody
      ever can judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor saw it all. Things happened so fast one after another that
      they quite confused his faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, let me go home," he cried at last, stopping his ears and shutting his
      eyes; "only let me go home!" for even his lonely tower seemed home, and
      its dreariness and silence absolute paradise after all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by, then," said the magpie, flapping her wings. She had been
      chatting incessantly all day and all night, for it was actually thus long
      that Prince Dolor had been hovering over the city, neither eating nor
      sleeping, with all these terrible things happening under his very eyes.
      "You've had enough, I suppose, of seeing the world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I have&mdash;I have!" cried the prince, with a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is, till next time. All right, your royal highness. You don't know
      me, but I know you. We may meet again some time."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with her clear, piercing eyes, sharp enough to see
      through everything, and it seemed as if they changed from bird's eyes to
      human eyes&mdash;the very eyes of his godmother, whom he had not seen for
      ever so long. But the minute afterward she became only a bird, and with a
      screech and a chatter, spread her wings and flew away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor fell into a kind of swoon of utter misery, bewilderment, and
      exhaustion, and when he awoke he found himself in his own room&mdash;alone
      and quiet&mdash;with the dawn just breaking, and the long rim of yellow
      light in the horizon glimmering through the window-panes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Prince Dolor sat up in bed, trying to remember where he was, whither
      he had been, and what he had seen the day before, he perceived that his
      room was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally his nurse rather worried him by breaking his slumbers, coming in
      and "setting things to rights," as she called it. Now the dust lay thick
      upon chairs and tables; there was no harsh voice heard to scold him for
      not getting up immediately, which, I am sorry to say, this boy did not
      always do. For he so enjoyed lying still, and thinking lazily about
      everything or nothing, that, if he had not tried hard against it, he would
      certainly have become like those celebrated
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Two little men
     Who lay in their bed till the clock struck ten."
</pre>
    <p>
      It was striking ten now, and still no nurse was to be seen. He was rather
      relieved at first, for he felt so tired; and besides, when he stretched
      out his arm, he found to his dismay that he had gone to bed in his
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very uncomfortable he felt, of course; and just a little frightened.
      Especially when he began to call and call again, but nobody answered.
      Often he used to think how nice it would be to get rid of his nurse and
      live in this tower all by himself&mdash;like a sort of monarch able to do
      everything he liked, and leave undone all that he did not want to do; but
      now that this seemed really to have happened, he did not like it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nurse,&mdash;dear nurse,&mdash;please come back!" he called out. "Come
      back, and I will be the best boy in all the land."
    </p>
    <p>
      And when she did not come back, and nothing but silence answered his
      lamentable call, he very nearly began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This won't do," he said at last, dashing the tears from his eyes. "It's
      just like a baby, and I'm a big boy&mdash;shall be a man some day. What
      has happened, I wonder? I'll go and see."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang out of bed,&mdash;not to his feet, alas! but to his poor little
      weak knees, and crawled on them from room to room. All the four chambers
      were deserted&mdash;not forlorn or untidy, for everything seemed to have
      been done for his comfort&mdash;the breakfast and dinner things were laid,
      the food spread in order. He might live "like a prince," as the proverb
      is, for several days. But the place was entirely forsaken&mdash;there was
      evidently not a creature but himself in the solitary tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great fear came upon the poor boy. Lonely as his life had been, he had
      never known what it was to be absolutely alone. A kind of despair seized
      him&mdash;no violent anger or terror, but a sort of patient desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What in the world am I to do?" thought he, and sat down in the middle of
      the floor, half inclined to believe that it would be better to give up
      entirely, lay himself down, and die.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feeling, however, did not last long, for he was young and strong,
      and, I said before, by nature a very courageous boy. There came into his
      head, somehow or other, a proverb that his nurse had taught him&mdash;the
      people of Nomansland were very fond of proverbs:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "For every evil under the sun
     There is a remedy, or there's none;
     If there is one, try to find it&mdash;
     If there isn't, never mind it."
</pre>
    <p>
      "I wonder is there a remedy now, and could I find it?" cried the Prince,
      jumping up and looking out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      No help there. He only saw the broad, bleak, sunshiny plain&mdash;that is,
      at first. But by and by, in the circle of mud that surrounded the base of
      the tower, he perceived distinctly the marks of a horse's feet, and just
      in the spot where the deaf-mute was accustomed to tie up his great black
      charger, while he himself ascended, there lay the remains of a bundle of
      hay and a feed of corn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's it. He has come and gone, taking nurse away with him. Poor
      nurse! how glad she would be to go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was Prince Dolor's first thought. His second&mdash;wasn't it natural?&mdash;was
      a passionate indignation at her cruelty&mdash;at the cruelty of all the
      world toward him, a poor little helpless boy. Then he determined, forsaken
      as he was, to try and hold on to the last, and not to die as long as he
      could possibly help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyhow, it would be easier to die here than out in the world, among the
      terrible doings which he had just beheld&mdash;from the midst of which, it
      suddenly struck him, the deaf-mute had come, contriving somehow to make
      the nurse understand that the king was dead, and she need have no fear in
      going back to the capital, where there was a grand revolution, and
      everything turned upside down. So, of course, she had gone. "I hope she'll
      enjoy it, miserable woman&mdash;if they don't cut off her head too."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then a kind of remorse smote him for feeling so bitterly toward her,
      after all the years she had taken care of him&mdash;grudgingly, perhaps,
      and coldly; still she had taken care of him, and that even to the last:
      for, as I have said, all his four rooms were as tidy as possible, and his
      meals laid out, that he might have no more trouble than could be helped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly she did not mean to be cruel. I won't judge her," said he. And
      afterward he was very glad that he had so determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second time he tried to dress himself, and then to do everything
      he could for himself&mdash;even to sweeping up the hearth and putting on
      more coals. "It's a funny thing for a prince to have to do," said he,
      laughing. "But my godmother once said princes need never mind doing
      anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he thought a little of his godmother. Not of summoning her, or
      asking her to help him,&mdash;she had evidently left him to help himself,
      and he was determined to try his best to do it, being a very proud and
      independent boy,&mdash;but he remembered her tenderly and regret-fully, as
      if even she had been a little hard upon him&mdash;poor, forlorn boy that
      he was. But he seemed to have seen and learned so much within the last few
      days that he scarcely felt like a boy, but a man&mdash;until he went to
      bed at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was a child, I used often to think how nice it would be to live in
      a little house all by my own self&mdash;a house built high up in a tree,
      or far away in a forest, or halfway up a hillside so deliciously alone and
      independent. Not a lesson to learn&mdash;but no! I always liked learning
      my lessons. Anyhow, to choose the lessons I liked best, to have as many
      books to read and dolls to play with as ever I wanted: above all, to be
      free and at rest, with nobody to tease or trouble or scold me, would be
      charming. For I was a lonely little thing, who liked quietness&mdash;as
      many children do; which other children, and sometimes grown-up people
      even, cannot understand. And so I can understand Prince Dolor.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his first despair, he was not merely comfortable, but actually happy
      in his solitude, doing everything for himself, and enjoying everything by
      himself&mdash;until bedtime. Then he did not like it at all. No more, I
      suppose, than other children would have liked my imaginary house in a tree
      when they had had sufficient of their own company.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Prince had to bear it&mdash;and he did bear it, like a prince&mdash;for
      fully five days. All that time he got up in the morning and went to bed at
      night without having spoken to a creature, or, indeed, heard a single
      sound. For even his little lark was silent; and as for his
      traveling-cloak, either he never thought about it, or else it had been
      spirited away&mdash;for he made no use of it, nor attempted to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very strange existence it was, those five lonely days. He never entirely
      forgot it. It threw him back upon himself, and into himself&mdash;in a way
      that all of us have to learn when we grow up, and are the better for it;
      but it is somewhat hard learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the sixth day Prince Dolor had a strange composure in his look, but he
      was very grave and thin and white. He had nearly come to the end of his
      provisions&mdash;and what was to happen next? Get out of the tower he
      could not: the ladder the deaf-mute used was always carried away again;
      and if it had not been, how could the poor boy have used it? And even if
      he slung or flung himself down, and by miraculous chance came alive to the
      foot of the tower, how could he run away?
    </p>
    <p>
      Fate had been very hard to him, or so it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made up his mind to die. Not that he wished to die; on the contrary,
      there was a great deal that he wished to live to do; but if he must die,
      he must. Dying did not seem so very dreadful; not even to lie quiet like
      his uncle, whom he had entirely forgiven now, and neither be miserable nor
      naughty any more, and escape all those horrible things that he had seen
      going on outside the palace, in that awful place which was called "the
      world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a great deal nicer here," said the poor little Prince, and collected
      all his pretty things round him: his favorite pictures, which he thought
      he should like to have near him when he died; his books and toys&mdash;no,
      he had ceased to care for toys now; he only liked them because he had done
      so as a child. And there he sat very calm and patient, like a king in his
      castle, waiting for the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, I wish I had done something first&mdash;something worth doing,
      that somebody might remember me by," thought he. "Suppose I had grown a
      man, and had had work to do, and people to care for, and was so useful and
      busy that they liked me, and perhaps even forgot I was lame? Then it would
      have been nice to live, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      A tear came into the little fellow's eyes, and he listened intently
      through the dead silence for some hopeful sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there one?&mdash;was it his little lark, whom he had almost forgotten?
      No, nothing half so sweet. But it really was something&mdash;something
      which came nearer and nearer, so that there was no mistaking it. It was
      the sound of a trumpet, one of the great silver trumpets so admired in
      Nomansland. Not pleasant music, but very bold, grand, and inspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he listened to it the boy seemed to recall many things which had
      slipped his memory for years, and to nerve himself for whatever might be
      going to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had happened was this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor condemned woman had not been such a wicked woman after all.
      Perhaps her courage was not wholly disinterested, but she had done a very
      heroic thing. As soon as she heard of the death and burial of the King and
      of the changes that were taking place in the country, a daring idea came
      into her head&mdash;to set upon the throne of Nomansland its rightful
      heir. Thereupon she persuaded the deaf-mute to take her away with him, and
      they galloped like the wind from city to city, spreading everywhere the
      news that Prince Dolor's death and burial had been an invention concocted
      by his wicked uncle that he was alive and well, and the noblest young
      prince that ever was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bold stroke, but it succeeded. The country, weary perhaps of the
      late King's harsh rule, and yet glad to save itself from the horrors of
      the last few days, and the still further horrors of no rule at all, and
      having no particular interest in the other young princes, jumped at the
      idea of this Prince, who was the son of their late good King and the
      beloved Queen Dolorez.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurrah for Prince Dolor! Let Prince Dolor be our sovereign!" rang from
      end to end of the kingdom. Everybody tried to remember what a dear baby he
      once was&mdash;how like his mother, who had been so sweet and kind, and
      his father, the finest-looking king that ever reigned. Nobody remembered
      his lameness&mdash;or, if they did, they passed it over as a matter of no
      consequence. They were determined to have him reign over them, boy as he
      was&mdash;perhaps just because he was a boy, since in that case the great
      nobles thought they should be able to do as they liked with the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, with a fickleness not confined to the people of Nomansland,
      no sooner was the late King laid in his grave than they pronounced him to
      have been a usurper; turned all his family out of the palace, and left it
      empty for the reception of the new sovereign, whom they went to fetch with
      great rejoicing, a select body of lords, gentlemen, and soldiers traveling
      night and day in solemn procession through the country until they reached
      Hopeless Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they found the Prince, sitting calmly on the floor&mdash;deadly
      pale, indeed, for he expected a quite different end from this, and was
      resolved, if he had to die, to die courageously, like a Prince and a King.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when they hailed him as Prince and King, and explained to him how
      matters stood, and went down on their knees before him, offering the crown
      (on a velvet cushion, with four golden tassels, each nearly as big as his
      head),&mdash;small though he was and lame, which lameness the courtiers
      pretended not to notice,&mdash;there came such a glow into his face, such
      a dignity into his demeanor, that he became beautiful, king-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said, "if you desire it, I will be your king. And I will do my
      best to make my people happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there arose, from inside and outside the tower, such a shout as never
      yet was heard across the lonely plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor shrank a little from the deafening sound. "How shall I be
      able to rule all this great people? You forget, my lords, that I am only a
      little boy still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so very little," was the respectful answer. "We have searched in the
      records, and found that your Royal Highness&mdash;your Majesty, I mean&mdash;is
      fifteen years old."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I?" said Prince Dolor; and his first thought was a thoroughly childish
      pleasure that he should now have a birthday, with a whole nation to keep
      it. Then he remembered that his childish days were done. He was a monarch
      now. Even his nurse, to whom, the moment he saw her, he had held out his
      hand, kissed it reverently, and called him ceremoniously "his Majesty the
      King."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A king must be always a king, I suppose," said he half-sadly, when, the
      ceremonies over, he had been left to himself for just ten minutes, to put
      off his boy's clothes and be reattired in magnificent robes, before he was
      conveyed away from his tower to the royal palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could take nothing with him; indeed, he soon saw that, however politely
      they spoke, they would not allow him to take anything. If he was to be
      their king, he must give up his old life forever. So he looked with tender
      farewell on his old books, old toys, the furniture he knew so well, and
      the familiar plain in all its levelness&mdash;ugly yet pleasant, simply
      because it was familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be a new life in a new world," said he to himself; "but I'll
      remember the old things still. And, oh! if before I go I could but once
      see my dear old godmother."
    </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke he had laid himself down on the bed for a minute or two,
      rather tired with his grandeur, and confused by the noise of the trumpets
      which kept playing incessantly down below. He gazed, half sadly, up to the
      skylight, whence there came pouring a stream of sunrays, with innumerable
      motes floating there, like a bridge thrown between heaven and earth.
      Sliding down it, as if she had been made of air, came the little old woman
      in gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      So beautiful looked she&mdash;old as she was&mdash;that Prince Dolor was
      at first quite startled by the apparition. Then he held out his arms in
      eager delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, godmother, you have not forsaken me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, my son. You may not have seen me, but I have seen you many a
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, never mind. I can turn into anything I please, you know. And I have
      been a bearskin rug, and a crystal goblet&mdash;and sometimes I have
      changed from inanimate to animate nature, put on feathers, and made myself
      very comfortable as a bird."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" laughed the prince, a new light breaking in upon him as he caught
      the infection of her tone, lively and mischievous. "Ha! ha! a lark, for
      instance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or a magpie," answered she, with a capital imitation of Mistress Mag's
      croaky voice. "Do you suppose I am always sentimental, and never funny? If
      anything makes you happy, gay, or grave, don't you think it is more than
      likely to come through your old godmother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe that," said the boy tenderly, holding out his arms. They
      clasped one another in a close embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Prince Dolor looked very anxious. "You will not leave me now that
      I am a king? Otherwise I had rather not be a king at all. Promise never to
      forsake me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The little old woman laughed gayly. "Forsake you? that is impossible. But
      it is just possible you may forsake me. Not probable though. Your mother
      never did, and she was a queen. The sweetest queen in all the world was
      the Lady Dolorez."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me about her," said the boy eagerly. "As I get older I think I can
      understand more. Do tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not now. You couldn't hear me for the trumpets and the shouting. But when
      you are come to the palace, ask for a long-closed upper room, which looks
      out upon the Beautiful Mountains; open it and take it for your own.
      Whenever you go there you will always find me, and we will talk together
      about all sorts of things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And about my mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The little old woman nodded&mdash;and kept nodding and smiling to herself
      many times, as the boy repeated over and over again the sweet words he had
      never known or understood&mdash;"my mother&mdash;my mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I must go," said she, as the trumpets blared louder and louder, and
      the shouts of the people showed that they would not endure any delay.
      "Good-by, good-by! Open the window and out I fly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Dolor repeated gayly the musical rhyme&mdash;but all the while
      tried to hold his godmother fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vain, vain! for the moment that a knocking was heard at his door the sun
      went behind a cloud, the bright stream of dancing motes vanished, and the
      little old woman with them&mdash;he knew not where.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Prince Dolor quitted his tower&mdash;which he had entered so mournfully
      and ignominiously as a little helpless baby carried in the deaf-mute's
      arms&mdash;quitted it as the great King of Nomansland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing he took away with him was something so insignificant that
      none of the lords, gentlemen, and soldiers who escorted him with such
      triumphant splendor could possibly notice it&mdash;a tiny bundle, which he
      had found lying on the floor just where the bridge of sunbeams had rested.
      At once he had pounced upon it, and thrust it secretly into his bosom,
      where it dwindled into such small proportions that it might have been
      taken for a mere chest-comforter, a bit of flannel, or an old
      pocket-handkerchief. It was his traveling-cloak!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      Did Prince Dolar become a great king? Was he, though little more than a
      boy, "the father of his people," as all kings ought to be? Did his reign
      last long&mdash;long and happy? and what were the principal events of it,
      as chronicled in the history of Nomansland?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, if I were to answer all these questions I should have to write
      another book. And I'm tired, children, tired&mdash;as grown-up people
      sometimes are, though not always with play. (Besides, I have a small
      person belonging to me, who, though she likes extremely to listen to the
      word-of-mouth story of this book, grumbles much at the writing of it, and
      has run about the house clapping her hands with joy when mamma told her
      that it was nearly finished. But that is neither here nor there.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I have related as well as I could the history of Prince Dolor, but with
      the history of Nomansland I am as yet unacquainted. If anybody knows it,
      perhaps he or she will kindly write it all down in another book. But mine
      is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, of this I am sure, that Prince Dolor made an excellent king.
      Nobody ever does anything less well, not even the commonest duty of common
      daily life, for having such a godmother as the little old woman clothed in
      gray, whose name is&mdash;well, I leave you to guess. Nor, I think, is
      anybody less good, less capable of both work and enjoyment in after-life,
      for having been a little unhappy in his youth, as the prince had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot take upon myself to say that he was always happy now&mdash;who
      is?&mdash;or that he had no cares; just show me the person who is quite
      free from them! But whenever people worried and bothered him&mdash;as they
      did sometimes, with state etiquette, state squabbles, and the like,
      setting up themselves and pulling down their neighbors&mdash;he would take
      refuge in that upper room which looked out on the Beautiful Mountains,
      and, laying his head on his godmother's shoulder, become calmed and at
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, she helped him out of any difficulty which now and then occurred&mdash;for
      there never was such a wise old woman. When the people of Nomansland
      raised the alarm&mdash;as sometimes they did&mdash;for what people can
      exist without a little fault-finding?&mdash;and began to cry out,
      "Un-happy is the nation whose king is a child," she would say to him
      gently, "You are a child. Accept the fact. Be humble&mdash;be teachable.
      Lean upon the wisdom of others till you have gained your own."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so. He learned how to take advice before attempting to give it, to
      obey before he could righteously command. He assembled round him all the
      good and wise of his kingdom&mdash;laid all its affairs before them, and
      was guided by their opinions until he had maturely formed his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      This he did sooner than anybody would have imagined who did not know of
      his godmother and his traveling-cloak&mdash;two secret blessings, which,
      though many guessed at, nobody quite understood. Nor did they understand
      why he loved so the little upper room, except that it had been his
      mother's room, from the window of which, as people remembered now, she had
      used to sit for hours watching the Beautiful Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of that window he used to fly&mdash;not very often; as he grew older,
      the labors of state prevented the frequent use of his traveling-cloak;
      still he did use it sometimes. Only now it was less for his own pleasure
      and amusement than to see something or investigate something for the good
      of the country. But he prized his godmother's gift as dearly as ever. It
      was a comfort to him in all his vexations, an enhancement of all his joys.
      It made him almost forget his lameness&mdash;which was never cured.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the cruel things which had been once foreboded of him did not
      happen. His misfortune was not such a heavy one, after all. It proved to
      be of much less inconvenience, even to himself, than had been feared. A
      council of eminent surgeons and mechanicians invented for him a wonderful
      pair of crutches, with the help of which, though he never walked easily or
      gracefully, he did manage to walk so as to be quite independent. And such
      was the love his people bore him that they never heard the sound of his
      crutches on the marble palace floors without a leap of the heart, for they
      knew that good was coming to them whenever he approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, though he never walked in processions, never reviewed his troops
      mounted on a magnificent charger, nor did any of the things which make a
      show monarch so much appreciated, he was able for all the duties and a
      great many of the pleasures of his rank. When he held his levees, not
      standing, but seated on a throne ingeniously contrived to hide his
      infirmity, the people thronged to greet him; when he drove out through the
      city streets, shouts followed him wherever he went&mdash;every countenance
      brightened as he passed, and his own, perhaps, was the brightest of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, because, accepting his affliction as inevitable, he took it
      patiently; second, because, being a brave man, he bore it bravely, trying
      to forget himself, and live out of himself, and in and for other people.
      Therefore other people grew to love him so well that I think hundreds of
      his subjects might have been found who were almost ready to die for their
      poor lame king.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never gave them a queen. When they implored him to choose one, he
      replied that his country was his bride, and he desired no other. But
      perhaps the real reason was that he shrank from any change; and that no
      wife in all the world would have been found so perfect, so lovable, so
      tender to him in all his weaknesses as his beautiful old godmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      His twenty-four other godfathers and godmothers, or as many of them as
      were still alive, crowded round him as soon as he ascended the throne. He
      was very civil to them all, but adopted none of the names they had given
      him, keeping to the one by which he had been always known, though it had
      now almost lost its meaning; for King Dolor was one of the happiest and
      cheerfulest men alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did a good many things, however, unlike most men and most kings, which
      a little astonished his subjects. First, he pardoned the condemned woman
      who had been his nurse, and ordained that from henceforth there should be
      no such thing as the punishment of death in Nomansland. All capital
      criminals were to be sent to perpetual imprisonment in Hopeless Tower and
      the plain round about it, where they could do no harm to anybody, and
      might in time do a little good, as the woman had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another surprise he shortly afterward gave the nation. He recalled his
      uncle's family, who had fled away in terror to another country, and
      restored them to all their honors in their own. By and by he chose the
      eldest son of his eldest cousin (who had been dead a year), and had him
      educated in the royal palace, as the heir to the throne. This little
      prince was a quiet, unobtrusive boy, so that everybody wondered at the
      King's choosing him when there were so many more; but as he grew into a
      fine young fellow, good and brave, they agreed that the King judged more
      wisely than they.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a lame prince, either," his Majesty observed one day, watching him
      affectionately; for he was the best runner, the highest leaper, the
      keenest and most active sportsman in the country. "One cannot make one's
      self, but one can sometimes help a little in the making of somebody else.
      It is well."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was said, not to any of his great lords and ladies, but to a good old
      woman&mdash;his first homely nurse whom he had sought for far and wide,
      and at last found in her cottage among the Beautiful Mountains. He sent
      for her to visit him once a year, and treated her with great honor until
      she died. He was equally kind, though somewhat less tender, to his other
      nurse, who, after receiving her pardon, returned to her native town and
      grew into a great lady, and I hope a good one. But as she was so grand a
      personage now, any little faults she had did not show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus King Dolor's reign passed year after year, long and prosperous.
      Whether he were happy&mdash;"as happy as a king"&mdash;is a question no
      human being can decide. But I think he was, because he had the power of
      making everybody about him happy, and did it too; also because he was his
      godmother's godson, and could shut himself up with her whenever he liked,
      in that quiet little room in view of the Beautiful Mountains, which nobody
      else ever saw or cared to see. They were too far off, and the city lay so
      low. But there they were, all the time. No change ever came to them; and I
      think, at any day throughout his long reign, the King would sooner have
      lost his crown than have lost sight of the Beautiful Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      In course of time, when the little Prince, his cousin, was grown into a
      tall young man, capable of all the duties of a man, his Majesty did one of
      the most extraordinary acts ever known in a sovereign beloved by his
      people and prosperous in his reign. He announced that he wished to invest
      his heir with the royal purple&mdash;at any rate, for a time&mdash;while
      he himself went away on a distant journey, whither he had long desired to
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody marveled, but nobody opposed him. Who could oppose the good
      King, who was not a young king now? And besides, the nation had a great
      admiration for the young regent&mdash;and possibly a lurking pleasure in
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there was a fixed day when all the people whom it would hold assembled
      in the great square of the capital, to see the young prince installed
      solemnly in his new duties, and undertaking his new vows. He was a very
      fine young fellow; tall and straight as a poplar tree, with a frank,
      handsome face&mdash;a great deal handsomer than the king, some people
      said, but others thought differently. However, as his Majesty sat on his
      throne, with his gray hair falling from underneath his crown, and a few
      wrinkles showing in spite of his smile, there was something about his
      countenance which made his people, even while they shouted, regard him
      with a tenderness mixed with awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted up his thin, slender hand, and there came a silence over the
      vast crowd immediately. Then he spoke, in his own accustomed way, using no
      grand words, but saying what he had to say in the simplest fashion, though
      with a clearness that struck their ears like the first song of a bird in
      the dusk of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My people, I am tired: I want to rest. I have had a long reign, and done
      much work&mdash;at least, as much as I was able to do. Many might have
      done it better than I&mdash;but none with a better will. Now I leave it to
      others; I am tired, very tired. Let me go home."
    </p>
    <p>
      There arose a murmur&mdash;of content or discontent none could well tell;
      then it died down again, and the assembly listened silently once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not anxious about you, my people&mdash;my children," continued the
      King. "You are prosperous and at peace. I leave you in good hands. The
      Prince Regent will be a fitter king for you than I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, no!" rose the universal shout&mdash;and those who had sometimes
      found fault with him shouted louder than anybody. But he seemed as if he
      heard them not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," said he, as soon as the tumult had a little subsided: and his
      voice sounded firm and clear; and some very old people, who boasted of
      having seen him as a child, declared that his face took a sudden change,
      and grew as young and sweet as that of the little Prince Dolor. "Yes, I
      must go. It is time for me to go. Remember me sometimes, my people, for I
      have loved you well. And I am going a long way, and I do not think I shall
      come back any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a little bundle out of his breast pocket&mdash;a bundle that
      nobody had ever seen before. It was small and shabby-looking, and tied up
      with many knots, which untied themselves in an instant. With a joyful
      countenance, he muttered over it a few half-intelligible words. Then, so
      suddenly that even those nearest to his Majesty could not tell how it came
      about, the King was away&mdash;away&mdash;floating right up in the air&mdash;upon
      something, they knew not what, except that it appeared to be as safe and
      pleasant as the wings of a bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after him sprang a bird&mdash;a dear little lark, rising from whence
      no one could say, since larks do not usually build their nests in the
      pavement of city squares. But there it was, a real lark, singing far over
      their heads, louder and clearer and more joyful as it vanished further
      into the blue sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shading their eyes, and straining their ears, the astonished people stood
      until the whole vision disappeared like a speck in the clouds&mdash;the
      rosy clouds that overhung the Beautiful Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Dolor was never again beheld or heard of in his own country. But the
      good he had done there lasted for years and years; he was long missed and
      deeply mourned&mdash;at least, so far as anybody could mourn one who was
      gone on such a happy journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whither he went, or who went with him, it is impossible to say. But I
      myself believe that his godmother took him on his traveling-cloak to the
      Beautiful Mountains. What he did there, or where he is now, who can tell?
      I cannot. But one thing I am quite sure of, that, wherever he is, he is
      perfectly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, when I think of him, am I.

    <h2>
      THE INVISIBLE PRINCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      THERE were a king and queen who were dotingly fond of their only son,
      notwithstanding that he was equally deformed in mind and person. The king
      was quite sensible of the evil disposition of his son, but the queen in
      her excessive fondness saw no fault whatever in her dear Furibon, as he
      was named. The surest way to win her favor was to praise Furibon for
      charms he did not possess. When he came of age to have a governor, the
      king made choice of a prince who had an ancient right to the crown, but
      was not able to support it. This prince had a son, named Leander,
      handsome, accomplished, amiable&mdash;in every respect the opposite of
      Prince Furibon. The two were frequently together, which only made the
      deformed prince more repulsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, certain ambassadors having arrived from a far country, the prince
      stood in a gallery to see them; when, taking Leander for the king's son,
      they made their obeisance to him, treating Furibon as a mere dwarf, at
      which the latter was so offended that he drew his sword, and would have
      done them a mischief had not the king just then appeared. As it was, the
      affair produced a quarrel, which ended in Leander's being sent to a
      far-away castle belonging to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, however, he was quite happy, for he was a great lover of hunting,
      fishing, and walking: he understood painting, read much, and played upon
      several instruments, so that he was glad to be freed from the fantastic
      humors of Furibon. One day as he was walking in the garden, finding the
      heat increase, he retired into a shady grove and began to play upon the
      flute to amuse himself. As he played, he felt something wind about his
      leg, and looking down saw a great adder: he took his handkerchief, and
      catching it by the head was going to kill it. But the adder, looking
      steadfastly in his face, seemed to beg his pardon. At this instant one of
      the gardeners happened to come to the place where Leander was, and spying
      the snake, cried out to his master: "Hold him fast, sir; it is but an hour
      since we ran after him to kill him: it is the most mischievous creature in
      the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander, casting his eyes a second time upon the snake, which was speckled
      with a thousand extraordinary colors, perceived the poor creature still
      looked upon him with an aspect that seemed to implore compassion, and
      never tried in the least to defend itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Though thou hast such a mind to kill it," said he to the gardener, "yet,
      as it came to me for refuge, I forbid thee to do it any harm; for I will
      keep it, and when it has cast its beautiful skin I will let it go." He
      then returned home, and carrying the snake with him, put it into a large
      chamber, the key of which he kept himself, and ordered bran, milk, and
      flowers to be given to it, for its delight and sustenance; so that never
      was snake so happy. Leander went sometimes to see it, and when it
      perceived him it made haste to meet him, showing him all the little marks
      of love and gratitude of which a poor snake was capable, which did not a
      little surprise him, though he took no further notice of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime all the court ladies were extremely troubled at his
      absence, and he was the subject of all their discourse. "Alas!" cried
      they, "there is no pleasure at court since Leander is gone, of whose
      absence the wicked Furibon is the cause!" Furibon also had his parasites,
      for his power over the queen made him feared; they told him what the
      ladies said, which enraged him to such a degree that in his passion he
      flew to the queen's chamber, and vowed he would kill himself before her
      face if she did not find means to destroy Leander. The queen, who also
      hated Leander, because he was handsomer than her son, replied that she had
      long looked upon him as a traitor, and therefore would willingly consent
      to his death. To which purpose she advised Furibon to go a-hunting with
      some of his confidants, and contrive it so that Leander should make one of
      the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said she, "you may find some way to punish him for pleasing
      everybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furibon understood her, and accordingly went a-hunting; and Leander, when
      he heard the horns and the hounds, mounted his horse and rode to see who
      it was. But he was surprised to meet the prince so unexpectedly; he
      alighted immediately and saluted him with respect; and Furibon received
      him more graciously than usual and bade follow him. All of a sudden he
      turned his horse and rode another way, making a sign to the ruffians to
      take the first opportunity to kill him; but before he had got quite out of
      sight, a lion of prodigious size, coming out of his den, leaped upon
      Furibon; all his followers fled, and only Leander remained; who, attacking
      the animal sword in hand, by his valor and agility saved the life of his
      most cruel enemy, who had fallen in a swoon from fear. When he recovered,
      Leander presented him his horse to remount. Now, any other than such a
      wretch would have been grateful, but Furibon did not even look upon him;
      nay, mounting the horse, he rode in quest of the ruffians, to whom he
      repeated his orders to kill him. They accordingly surrounded Leander, who,
      setting his back to a tree, behaved with so much bravery that he laid them
      all dead at his feet. Furibon, believing him by this time slain, rode
      eagerly up to the spot. When Leander saw him he advanced to meet him.
      "Sir," said he, "if it was by your order that these assassins came to kill
      me, I am sorry I made any defense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are an insolent villain!" replied Furibon, "and if ever you come into
      my presence again, you shall surely die."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander made no answer, but retired sad and pensive to his own home, where
      he spent the night in pondering what was best for him to do; for there was
      no likelihood he should be able to defend himself against the power of the
      king's son; therefore he at length concluded he would travel abroad and
      see the world. Being ready to depart, he recollected his snake, and,
      calling for some milk and fruits, carried them to the poor creature for
      the last time; but on opening the door he perceived an extraordinary
      luster in one corner of the room, and casting his eye on the place he was
      surprised to see a lady, whose noble and majestic air made him immediately
      conclude she was a princess of royal birth. Her habit was of purple satin,
      embroidered with pearls and diamonds; she advanced toward him with a
      gracious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young prince," said she, "you find no longer your pet snake, but me, the
      fairy Gentilla, ready to requite your generosity. For know that we fairies
      live a hundred years in flourishing youth, without diseases, without
      trouble or pain; and this term being expired, we become snakes for eight
      days. During that time it is not in our power to prevent any misfortune
      that may befall us; and if we happen to be killed, we never revive again.
      But these eight days being expired, we resume our usual form and recover
      our beauty, our power, and our riches. Now you know how much I am obliged
      to your goodness, and it is but just that I should repay my debt of
      gratitude; think how I can serve you and depend on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young prince, who had never conversed with a fairy till now, was so
      surprised that it was a long time before he could speak. But at length,
      making a profound reverence, "Madam," said he, "since I have had the honor
      to serve you, I know not any other happiness that I can wish for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be sorry," replied she, "not to be of service to you in
      something; consider, it is in my power to bestow on you long life,
      kingdoms, riches; to give you mines of diamonds and houses full of gold; I
      can make you an excellent orator, poet, musician, and painter; or, if you
      desire it, a spirit of the air, the water, or the earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Leander interrupted her. "Permit me, madam," said he, "to ask you
      what benefit it would be to me to be a spirit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much," replied the fairy, "you would be invisible when you pleased, and
      might in an instant traverse the whole earth; you would be able to fly
      without wings, to descend into the abyss of the earth without dying, and
      walk at the bottom of the sea without being drowned; nor doors, nor
      windows, though fast shut and locked, could hinder you from entering
      anywhere; and whenever you had a mind, you might resume your natural
      form."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, madam!" cried Leander, "then let me be a spirit; I am going to
      travel, and should prefer it above all those other advantages you have so
      generously offered me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentilla thereupon stroking his face three times, "Be a spirit," said she;
      and then, embracing him, she gave him a little red cap with a plume of
      feathers. "When you put on this cap you shall be invisible; but when you
      take it off you shall again become visible."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander, overjoyed, put his little red cap upon his head and wished
      himself in the forest, that he might gather some wild roses which he had
      observed there: his body immediately became as light as thought; he flew
      through the window like a bird; though, in flying over the river, he was
      not without fear lest he should fall into it, and the power of the fairy
      not be able to save him. But he arrived in safety at the rose-bushes,
      plucked the three roses, and returned immediately to his chamber;
      presented his roses to the fairy, overjoyed that his first experiments had
      succeeded so well. She bade him keep the roses, for that one of them would
      supply him with money whenever he wanted it; that if he put the other into
      his mistress' bosom, he would know whether she was faithful or not; and
      that the third would keep him always in good health. Then, without staying
      to receive his thanks, she wished him success in his travels and
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander, infinitely pleased, settled his affairs, mounted the finest horse
      in the stable, called Gris-de-line, and attended by some of his servants
      in livery, made his return to court. Now you must know Furibon had given
      out that had it not been for his courage Leander would have murdered him
      when they were a-hunting; so the king, being importuned by the queen, gave
      orders that Leander should be apprehended. But when he came, he showed so
      much courage and resolution that Furibon ran to the queen's chamber and
      prayed her to order him to be seized. The queen, who was extremely
      diligent in everything that her son desired, went immediately to the king.
      Furibon, being impatient to know what would be resolved, followed her; but
      stopped at the door and laid his ear to the keyhole, putting his hair
      aside that he might the better hear what was said. At the same time,
      Leander entered the court-hall of the palace with his red cap upon his
      head, and perceiving Furibon listening at the door of the king's chamber,
      he took a nail and a hammer and nailed his ear to the door. Furibon began
      to roar, so that the queen, hearing her son's voice, ran and opened the
      door, and, pulling it hastily, tore her son's ear from his head. Half out
      of her wits, she set him in her lap, took up his ear, kissed it, and
      clapped it again upon its place; but the invisible Leander, seizing upon a
      handful of twigs, with which they corrected the king's little dogs, gave
      the queen several lashes upon her hands, and her son as many on the nose:
      upon which the queen cried out, "Murder! murder!" and the king looked
      about, and the people came running in; but nothing was to be seen. Some
      cried that the queen was mad, and that her madness proceeded from her
      grief to see that her son had lost one ear; and the king was as ready as
      any to believe it, so that when she came near him he avoided her, which
      made a very ridiculous scene. Leander, then leaving the chamber, went into
      the garden, and there, assuming his own shape, he boldly began to pluck
      the queen's cherries, apricots, strawberries, and flowers, though he knew
      she set such a high value on them that it was as much as a man's life was
      worth to touch one. The gardeners, all amazed, came and told their
      majesties that Prince Leander was making havoc of all the fruits and
      flowers in the queen's gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What insolence!" said the queen: then turning to Furibon, "my pretty
      child, forget the pain of thy ear but for a moment, and fetch that vile
      wretch hither; take our guards, both horse and foot, seize him, and punish
      him as he deserves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Furibon, encouraged by his mother, and attended by a great number of armed
      soldiers, entered the garden and saw Leander; who, taking refuge under a
      tree, pelted them all with oranges. But when they came running toward him,
      thinking to have seized him, he was not to be seen; he had slipped behind
      Furibon, who was in a bad condition already. But Leander played him one
      trick more; for he pushed him down upon the gravel walk, and frightened
      him so that the soldiers had to take him up, carry him away, and put him
      to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied with this revenge, he returned to his servants, who waited for
      him, and giving them money, sent them back to his castle, that none might
      know the secret of his red cap and roses. As yet he had not determined
      whither to go; however, he mounted his fine horse Gris-de-line, and,
      laying the reins upon his neck, let him take his own road: at length he
      arrived in a forest, where he stopped to shelter himself from the heat. He
      had not been above a minute there before he heard a lamentable noise of
      sighing and sobbing; and looking about him, beheld a man, who ran,
      stopped, then ran again, sometimes crying, sometimes silent, then tearing
      his hair, then thumping his breast like some unfortunate madman. Yet he
      seemed to be both handsome and young: his garments had been magnificent,
      but he had torn them all to tatters. The prince, moved with compassion,
      made toward him, and mildly accosted him. "Sir," said he, "your condition
      appears so deplorable that I must ask the cause of your sorrow, assuring
      you of every assistance in my power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir," answered the young man, "nothing can cure my grief; this day my
      dear mistress is to be sacrificed to a rich old ruffian of a husband who
      will make her miserable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does she love you, then?" asked Leander.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I flatter myself so," answered the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is she?" continued Leander.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the castle at the end of this forest," replied the lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Leander; "stay you here till I come again, and in a
      little while I will bring you good news."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then put on his little red cap and wished himself in the castle. He had
      hardly got thither before he heard all sorts of music; he entered into a
      great room, where the friends and kindred of the old man and the young
      lady were assembled. No one could look more amiable than she; but the
      paleness of her complexion, the melancholy that appeared in her
      countenance, and the tears that now and then dropped, as it were by
      stealth from her eyes, betrayed the trouble of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander now became invisible, and placed himself in a corner of the room.
      He soon perceived the father and mother of the bride; and coming behind
      the mother's chair, whispered in her ear, "If you marry your daughter to
      that old dotard, before eight days are over you shall certainly die." The
      woman, frightened to hear such a terrible sentence pronounced upon her,
      and yet not know from whence it came, gave a loud shriek and dropped upon
      the floor. Her husband asked what ailed her: she cried that she was a dead
      woman if the marriage of her daughter went forward, and therefore she
      would not consent to it for all the world. Her husband laughed at her and
      called her a fool. But the invisible Leander accosting the man, threatened
      him in the same way, which frightened him so terribly that he also
      insisted on the marriage being broken off. When the lover complained,
      Leander trod hard upon his gouty toes and rang such an alarm in his ears
      that, not being able any longer to hear himself speak, away he limped,
      glad enough to go. The real lover soon appeared, and he and his fair
      mistress fell joyfully into one another's arms, the parents consenting to
      their union. Leander, assuming his own shape, appeared at the hall door,
      as if he were a stranger drawn thither by the report of this extraordinary
      wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      From hence he traveled on, and came to a great city, where, upon his
      arrival, he understood there was a great and solemn procession, in order
      to shut up a young woman against her will among the vestal-nuns. The
      prince was touched with compassion; and thinking the best use he could
      make of his cap was to redress public wrongs and relieve the oppressed, he
      flew to the temple, where he saw the young woman, crowned with flowers,
      clad in white, and with her disheveled hair flowing about her shoulders.
      Two of her brothers led her by each hand, and her mother followed her with
      a great crowd of men and women. Leander, being invisible, cried out,
      "Stop, stop, wicked brethren: stop, rash and inconsiderate mother; if you
      proceed any further, you shall be squeezed to death like so many frogs."
      They looked about, but could not conceive from whence these terrible
      menaces came. The brothers said it was only their sister's lover, who had
      hid himself in some hole; at which Leander, in wrath, took a long cudgel,
      and they had no reason to say the blows were not well laid on. The
      multitude fled, the vestals ran away, and Leander was left alone with the
      victim; immediately he pulled off his red cap and asked her wherein he
      might serve her. She answered him that there was a certain gentleman whom
      she would be glad to marry, but that he wanted an estate. Leander then
      shook his rose so long that he supplied them with ten millions; after
      which they were married and lived happily together.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his last adventure was the most agreeable. Entering into a wide
      forest, he heard lamentable cries. Looking about him every way, at length
      he spied four men well armed, who were carrying away by force a young
      lady, thirteen or fourteen years of age; upon which, making up to them as
      fast as he could, "What harm has that girl done?" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! ha! my little master," cried he who seemed to be the ringleader of
      the rest, "who bade you inquire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let her alone," said Leander, "and go about your business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, to be sure," cried they, laughing; whereupon the prince,
      alighting, put on his red cap, not thinking it otherwise prudent to attack
      four who seemed strong enough to fight a dozen. One of them stayed to take
      care of the young lady, while the three others went after Gris-de-line,
      who gave them a great deal of unwelcome exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the young lady continued her cries and complaints. "Oh, my dear
      princess," said she, "how happy was I in your palace! Did you but know my
      sad misfortune, you would send your Amazons to rescue poor Abricotina."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander, having listened to what she said, without delay seized the
      ruffian that held her, and bound him fast to a tree before he had time or
      strength to defend himself. He then went to the second, and taking him by
      both arms, bound him in the same manner to another tree. In the meantime
      Abricotina made the best of her good fortune and betook herself to her
      heels, not knowing which way she went. But Leander, missing her, called
      out to his horse Gris-de-line; who, by two kicks with his hoof, rid
      himself of the two ruffians who had pursued him: one of them had his head
      broken and the other three of his ribs. And now Leander only wanted to
      overtake Abricotina; for he thought her so handsome that he wished to see
      her again. He found her leaning against a tree. When she saw Gris-de-line
      coming toward her, "How lucky am I!" cried she; "this pretty little horse
      will carry me to the palace of pleasure." Leander heard her, though she
      saw him not: he rode up to her; Gris-de-line stopped, and when Abricotina
      mounted him, Leander clasped her in his arms and placed her gently before
      him. Oh, how great was Abricotina's fear to feel herself fast embraced,
      and yet see nobody! She durst not stir, and shut her eyes for fear of
      seeing a spirit. But Leander took off his little cap. "How comes it, fair
      Abricotina," said he, "that you are afraid of me, who delivered you out of
      the hands of the ruffians?"
    </p>
    <p>
      With that she opened her eyes, and knowing him again, "Oh, sir," said she,
      "I am infinitely obliged to you; but I was afraid, for I felt myself held
      fast and could see no one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely," replied Leander, "the danger you have been in has disturbed you
      and cast a mist before your eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abricotina would not seem to doubt him, though she was otherwise extremely
      sensible. And after they had talked for some time of indifferent things,
      Leander requested her to tell him her age, her country, and by what
      accident she fell into the hands of the ruffians.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Know then, sir," said she, "there was a certain very great fairy married
      to a prince who wearied of her: she therefore banished him from her
      presence, and established herself and daughter in the Island of Calm
      Delights. The princess, who is my mistress, being very fair, has many
      lovers&mdash;among others, one named Furibon, whom she detests; he it was
      whose ruffians seized me to-day when I was wandering in search of a stray
      parrot. Accept, noble prince, my best thanks for your valor, which I shall
      never forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander said how happy he was to have served her, and asked if he could
      not obtain admission into the island. Abricotina assured him this was
      impossible, and therefore he had better forget all about it. While they
      were thus conversing, they came to the bank of a large river. Abricotina
      alighted with a nimble jump from the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, sir," said she to the prince, making a profound reverence; "I
      wish you every happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I," said Leander, "wish that I may now and then have a small share in
      your remembrance."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he galloped away and soon entered into the thickest part of the
      wood, near a river, where he unbridled and unsaddled Gris-de-line; then,
      putting on his little cap, wished himself in the Island of Calm Delights,
      and his wish was immediately accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The palace was of pure gold, and stood upon pillars of crystal and
      precious stones, which represented the zodiac and all the wonders of
      nature; all the arts and sciences; the sea, with all the variety of fish
      therein contained; the earth, with all the various creatures which it
      produces; the chases of Diana and her nymphs; the noble exercises of the
      Amazons; the amusements of a country life; flocks of sheep with their
      shepherds and dogs; the toils of agriculture, harvesting, gardening. And
      among all this variety of representations there was neither man nor boy to
      be seen&mdash;not so much as a little winged Cupid; so highly had the
      princess been incensed against her inconstant husband as not to show the
      least favor to his fickle sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abricotina did not deceive me," said Leander to himself; "they have
      banished from hence the very idea of men; now let us see what they have
      lost by it." With that he entered into the palaces and at every step he
      took he met with objects so wonderful that when he had once fixed his eyes
      upon them he had much ado to take them off again. He viewed a vast number
      of these apartments, some full of china, no less fine than curious; others
      lined with porcelain, so delicate that the walls were quite transparent.
      Coral, jasper, agates, and cornelians adorned the rooms of state, and the
      presence-chamber was one entire mirror. The throne was one great pearl,
      hollowed like a shell; the princess sat, surrounded by her maidens, none
      of whom could compare with herself. In her was all the innocent sweetness
      of youth, joined to the dignity of maturity; in truth, she was perfection;
      and so thought the invisible Leander.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not seeing Abricotina, she asked where she was. Upon that, Leander, being
      very desirous to speak, assumed the tone of a parrot, for there were many
      in the room, and addressed himself invisibly to the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most charming princess," said he, "Abricotina will return immediately.
      She was in great danger of being carried away from this place but for a
      young prince who rescued her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess was surprised at the parrot, his answer was so extremely
      pertinent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very rude, little parrot," said the princess; "and Abricotina,
      when she comes, shall chastise you for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not be chastised," answered Leander, still counterfeiting the
      parrot's voice; "moreover, she will let you know the great desire that
      stranger had to be admitted into this palace, that he might convince you
      of the falsehood of those ideas which you have conceived against his sex."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In truth, pretty parrot," cried the princess, "it is a pity you are not
      every day so diverting; I should love you dearly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! if prattling will please you, princess," replied Leander, "I will
      prate from morning till night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," continued the princess, "how shall I be sure my parrot is not a
      sorcerer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is more in love than any sorcerer can be," replied the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Abricotina entered the room, and falling at her lovely
      mistress' feet, gave her a full account of what had befallen her, and
      described the prince in the most glowing colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have hated all men," added she, "had I not seen him! Oh, madam,
      how charming he is! His air and all his behavior have something in them so
      noble; and though whatever he spoke was infinitely pleasing, yet I think I
      did well in not bringing him hither."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this the princess said nothing, but she asked Abricotina a hundred
      other questions concerning the prince; whether she knew his name, his
      country, his birth, from whence he came, and whither he was going; and
      after this she fell into a profound thoughtfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander observed everything, and continued to chatter as he had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abricotina is ungrateful, madam," said he; "that poor stranger will die
      for grief if he sees you not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, parrot, let him die," answered the princess with a sigh; "and since
      thou undertakest to reason like a person of wit, and not a little bird, I
      forbid thee to talk to me any more of this unknown person."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander was overjoyed to find that Abricotina's and the parrot's discourse
      had made such an impression on the princess. He looked upon her with
      pleasure and delight. "Can it be," said he to himself, "that the
      masterpiece of nature, that the wonder of our age, should be confined
      eternally in an island, and no mortal dare to approach her? But,"
      continued he, "wherefore am I concerned that others are banished hence,
      since I have the happiness to be with her, to hear and to admire her; nay,
      more, to love her above all the women in the universe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late, and the princess retired into a large room of marble and
      porphyry, where several bubbling fountains, refreshed the air with an
      agreeable coolness. As soon as she entered the music began, a sumptuous
      supper was served up, and the birds from several aviaries on each side of
      the room, of which Abricotina had the chief care, opened their little
      throats in the most agreeable manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander had traveled a journey long enough to give him a good appetite,
      which made him draw near the table, where the very smell of such viands
      was agreeable and refreshing. The princess had a curious tabby-cat, for
      which she had a great kindness. This cat one of the maids of honor held in
      her arms, saying, "Madam, Bluet is hungry!" With that a chair was
      presently brought for the cat; for he was a cat of quality, and had a
      necklace of pearl about his neck. He was served on a golden plate with a
      laced napkin before him; and the plate being supplied with meat, Bluet sat
      with the solemn importance of an alderman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho! ho!" cried Leander to himself; "an idle tabby malkin, that perhaps
      never caught a mouse in his life, and I dare say is not descended from a
      better family than myself, has the honor to sit at table with my mistress:
      I would fain know whether he loves her so well as I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, he placed himself in the chair with the cat upon his knee,
      for nobody saw him, because he had his little red cap on; finding Bluet's
      plate well supplied with partridge, quails, and pheasants, he made so free
      with them that whatever was set before Master Puss disappeared in a trice.
      The whole court said no cat ever ate with a better appetite. There were
      excellent ragouts, and the prince made use of the cat's paw to taste them;
      but he sometimes pulled his paw too roughly, and Bluet, not understanding
      raillery, began to mew and be quite out of patience. The princess
      observing it, "Bring that fricassee and that tart to poor Bluet," said
      she; "see how he cries to have them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander laughed to himself at the pleasantness of this adventure; but he
      was very thirsty, not being accustomed to make such large meals without
      drinking. By the help of the cat's paw he got a melon, with which he
      somewhat quenched his thirst; and when supper was quite over, he went to
      the buffet and took two bottles of delicious wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess now retired into her boudoir, ordering Abricotina to follow
      her and make fast the door; but they could not keep out Leander, who was
      there as soon as they. However, the princess, believing herself alone with
      her confidante:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abricotina," said she, "tell me truly, did you exaggerate in your
      description of the unknown prince, for methinks it is impossible he should
      be as amiable as you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," replied the damsel, "if I have failed in anything, it was in
      coming short of what was due to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess sighed and was silent for a time; then resuming her speech:
      "I am glad," said she, "thou didst not bring him with thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, madam," answered Abricotina, who was a cunning girl, and already
      penetrated her mistress' thoughts, "suppose he had come to admire the
      wonders of these beautiful mansions, what harm could he have done us? Will
      you live eternally unknown in a corner of the world, concealed from the
      rest of human kind? Of what use is all your grandeur, pomp, magnificence,
      if nobody sees it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold thy peace, prattler," replied the princess, "and do not disturb that
      happy repose which I have enjoyed so long."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abricotina durst make no reply; and the princess, having waited her answer
      for some time, asked her whether she had anything to say. Abricotina then
      said she thought it was to very little purpose her mistress having sent
      her picture to the courts of several princes, where it only served to make
      those who saw it miserable; that every one would be desirous to marry her,
      and as she could not marry them all, indeed none of them, it would make
      them desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet, for all that," said the princess, "I could wish my picture were in
      the hands of this same stranger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, madam," answered Abricotina, "is not his desire to see you violent
      enough already? Would you augment it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," cried the princess; "a certain impulse of vanity, which I was never
      sensible of till now, has bred this foolish fancy in me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander heard all this discourse, and lost not a tittle of what she said;
      some of her expressions gave him hope, others absolutely destroyed it. The
      princess presently asked Abricotina whether she had seen anything
      extraordinary during her short travels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," said she, "I passed through one forest where I saw certain
      creatures that resembled little children: they skip and dance upon the
      trees like squirrels; they are very ugly, but have wonderful agility and
      address."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I had one of them," said the princess; "but if they are so nimble
      as you say they are, it is impossible to catch one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander, who passed through the same forest, knew what Abricotina meant,
      and presently wished himself in the place. He caught a dozen of little
      monkeys, some bigger, some less, and all of different colors, and with
      much ado put them into a large sack; then, wishing himself at Paris,
      where, he had heard, a man might have everything for money, he went and
      bought a little gold chariot. He taught six green monkeys to draw it; they
      were harnessed with fine traces of flame-colored morocco leather. He went
      to another place, where he met with two monkeys of merit, the most
      pleasant of which was called Briscambril, the other Pierceforest&mdash;both
      very spruce and well educated. He dressed Briscambril like a king and
      placed him in the coach; Pierceforest he made the coachman; the others
      were dressed like pages; all which he put into his sack, coach and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess not being gone to bed, heard a rumbling of a little coach in
      the long gallery; at the same time, her ladies came to tell her that the
      king of the dwarfs was arrived, and the chariot immediately entered her
      chamber with all the monkey train. The country monkeys began to show a
      thousand tricks, which far surpassed those of Briscambril and
      Pierceforest. To say the truth, Leander conducted the whole machine. He
      drew the chariot where Briscambril sat arrayed as a king, and making him
      hold a box of diamonds in his hand, he presented it with a becoming grace
      to the princess. The princess' surprise may be easily imagined. Moreover,
      Briscambril made a sign for Pierceforest to come and dance with him. The
      most celebrated dancers were not to be compared with them in activity. But
      the princess, troubled that she could not guess from whence this curious
      present came, dismissed the dancers sooner than she would otherwise have
      done, though she was extremely pleased with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander, satisfied with having seen the delight the princess had taken in
      beholding the monkeys, thought of nothing now but to get a little repose,
      which he greatly wanted. He stayed sometime in the great gallery;
      afterward, going down a pair of stairs, and finding a door open, he
      entered into an apartment the most delightful that ever was seen. There
      was in it a bed of cloth-of-gold, enriched with pearls, intermixed with
      rubies and emeralds: for by this time there appeared daylight sufficient
      for him to view and admire the magnificence of this sumptuous furniture.
      Having made fast the door, he composed himself to sleep. Next day he rose
      very early, and looking about on every side, he spied a painter's pallet,
      with colors ready prepared and pencils. Remembering what the princess had
      said to Abricotina touching her own portrait, he immediately (for he could
      paint as well as the most excellent masters) seated himself before a
      mirror and drew his own picture first; then, in an oval, that of the
      princess. He had all her features so strong in his imagination that he had
      no occasion for her sitting; and as his desire to please her had set him
      to work, never did portrait bear a stronger resemblance. He had painted
      himself upon one knee, holding the princess' picture in one hand, and in
      the other a label with this inscription, "She is better in my heart." When
      the princess went into her cabinet, she was amazed to see the portrait of
      a man; and she fixed her eyes upon it with so much the more surprise,
      because she also saw her own with it, and because the words which were
      written upon the label afforded her ample room for curiosity. She
      persuaded herself that it was Abricotina's doing; and all she desired to
      know was whether the portrait was real or imaginary. Rising in haste, she
      called Abricotina, while the invisible Leander, with his little red cap,
      slipped into the cabinet, impatient to know what passed. The princess bade
      Abricotina look upon the picture and tell her what she thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had viewed it, "I protest!" said she, "'tis the picture of that
      generous stranger to whom I am indebted for my life. Yes, yes, I am sure
      it is he; his very features, shape, and hair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou pretendest surprise," said the princess, "but I know it was thou
      thyself who put it there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who! I, madam?" replied Abricotina. "I protest I never saw the picture
      before in my life. Should I be so bold as to conceal from your knowledge a
      thing that so nearly concerns you? And by what miracle could I come by it?
      I never could paint, nor did any man ever enter this place; yet here he is
      painted with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some spirit, then, must have brought it hither," cried the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How I tremble for fear, madam!" said Abricotina. "Was it not rather some
      lover? And therefore, if you will take my advice, let us burn it
      immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Twere a pity to burn it," cried the princess, sighing; "a finer piece,
      methinks, cannot adorn my cabinet." And saying these words, she cast her
      eyes upon it. But Abricotina continued obstinate in her opinion that it
      ought to be burned, as a thing that could not come there but by the power
      of magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And these words&mdash;'She is better in my heart,'" said the princess;
      "must we burn them too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No favor must be shown to anything," said Abricotina, "not even to your
      own portrait."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abricotina ran away immediately for some fire, while the princess went to
      look out at the window. Leander, unwilling to let his performance be
      burned, took this opportunity to convey it away without being perceived.
      He had hardly quitted the cabinet, when the princess turned about to look
      once more upon that enchanting picture, which had so delighted her. But
      how was she surprised to find it gone! She sought for it all the room
      over; and Abricotina, returning, was no less surprised than her mistress;
      so that this last adventure put them both in the most terrible fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander took great delight in hearing and seeing his incomparable
      mistress; even though he had to eat every day at her table with the
      tabby-cat, who fared never the worse for that; but his satisfaction was
      far from being complete, seeing he durst neither speak nor show himself;
      and he knew it was not a common thing for ladies to fall in love with
      persons invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess had a universal taste for amusement. One day, she was saying
      to her attend-ants that it would give her great pleasure to know how the
      ladies were dressed in all the courts of the universe. There needed no
      more words to send Leander all over the world. He wished himself in China,
      where he bought the richest stuffs he could lay his hands on, and got
      patterns of all the court fashions. From thence he flew to Siam, where he
      did the same; in three days he traveled over all the four parts of the
      world, and from time to time brought what he bought to the Palace of Calm
      Delights, and hid it all in a chamber, which he kept always locked. When
      he had thus collected together all the rarities he could meet with&mdash;for
      he never wanted money, his rose always supplying him&mdash;he went and
      bought five or six dozen of dolls, which he caused to be dressed at Paris,
      the place in the world where most regard is paid to fashions. They were
      all dressed differently, and as magnificent as could be, and Leander
      placed them all in the princess' closet. When she entered it, she was
      agreeably surprised to see such company of little mutes, every one decked
      with watches bracelets, diamond buckles, or necklaces; and the most
      remarkable of them held a picture box in its hand, which the princess
      opening, found it contained Leander's portrait. She gave a loud shriek,
      and looking upon Abricotina, "There have appeared of late," said she, "so
      many wonders in this place, that I know not what to think of them: my
      birds are all grown witty; I cannot so much as wish, but presently I have
      my desires; twice have I now seen the portrait of him who rescued thee
      from the ruffians; and here are silks of all sorts, diamonds,
      embroideries, laces, and an infinite number of other rarities. What fairy
      is it that takes such care to pay me these agreeable civilities?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander was overjoyed to hear and see her so much interested about his
      picture, and calling to mind that there was in a grotto which she often
      frequented a certain pedestal, on which a Diana, not yet finished, was to
      be erected, on this pedestal he resolved to place himself, crowned with
      laurel, and holding a lyre in his hand, on which he played like another
      Apollo. He most anxiously waited the princess' retiring to the grotto,
      which she did every day since her thoughts had taken up with this unknown
      person; for what Abricotina had said, joined to the sight of the picture,
      had almost destroyed her repose: her lively humor changed into a pensive
      melancholy, and she grew a great lover of solitude. When she entered the
      grotto, she made a sign that nobody should follow her, so that her young
      damsels dispersed themselves into the neighboring walks. The princess
      threw herself upon a bank of green turf, sighed, wept, and even talked,
      but so softly that Leander could not hear what she said. He had put his
      red cap on, that she might not see him at first; but having taken it off,
      she beheld him standing on the pedestal. At first she took him for a real
      statue, for he observed exactly the attitude in which he had placed
      himself, without moving so much as a finger. She beheld with a kind of
      pleasure intermixed with fear, but pleasure soon dispelled her fear, and
      she continued to view the pleasing figure, which so exactly resembled
      life. The prince having tuned his lyre, began to play; at which the
      princess, greatly surprised, could not resist the fear that seized her;
      she grew pale and fell into a swoon. Leander leaped from the pedestal, and
      putting on his little red cap, that he might not be perceived, took the
      princess in his arms and gave her all the assistance that his zeal and
      tenderness could inspire. At length she opened her charming eyes and
      looked about in search of him, but she could perceive nobody; yet she felt
      somebody who held her hands, kissed them, and bedewed them with his tears.
      It was a long time before she durst speak, and her spirits were in a
      confused agitation between fear and hope. She was afraid of the spirit,
      but loved the figure of the unknown. At length she said: "Courtly
      invisible, why are you not the person I desire you should be?" At these
      words Leander was going to declare himself, but durst not do it yet.
      "For," thought he, "if I again affright the object I adore and make her
      fear me, she will not love me." This consideration caused him to keep
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess, then, believing herself alone, called Abricotina and told
      her all the wonders of the animated statue; that it had played divinely,
      and that the invisible person had given her great assistance when she lay
      in a swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What pity 'tis," said she, "that this person should be so frightful, for
      nothing can be more amiable or acceptable than his behavior!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who told you, madam," answered Abricotina, "that he is frightful? If he
      is the youth who saved me, he is beautiful as Cupid himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Cupid and the unknown are the same," replied the princess, blushing,
      "I could be content to love Cupid; but alas! how far am I from such a
      happiness! I love a mere shadow; and this fatal picture, joined to what
      thou hast told me, have inspired me with inclinations so contrary to the
      precepts which I received from my mother that I am daily afraid of being
      punished for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! madam," said Abricotina, interrupting her, "have you not troubles
      enough already? Why should you anticipate afflictions which may never come
      to pass?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to imagine what pleasure Leander took in this conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the little Furibon, still enamored of the princess whom he
      had never seen, expected with impatience the return of the four servants
      whom he had sent to the Island of Calm Delights. One of them at last came
      back, and after he had given the prince a particular account of what had
      passed, told him that the island was defended by Amazons, and that unless
      he sent a very powerful army, it would be impossible to get into it. The
      king his father was dead, and Furibon was now lord of all: disdaining,
      therefore, any repulse, he raised an army of four hundred thousand men,
      and put himself at the head of them, appearing like another Tom Thumb upon
      a war-horse. Now, when the Amazons perceived his mighty host, they gave
      the princess notice of its who immediately dispatched away her trusty
      Abricotina to the kingdom of the fairies, to beg her mother's instructions
      as to what she should do to drive the little Furibon from her territories.
      But Abricotina found the fairy in an angry humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing that my daughter does," said she, "escapes my knowledge. The
      Prince Leander is now in her palace; he loves her, and she has a
      tenderness for him. All my cares and precepts have not been able to guard
      her from the tyranny of love, and she is now under its fatal dominion. But
      it is the decree of destiny, and I must submit; therefore, Abricotina,
      begone! nor let me hear a word more of a daughter whose behavior has so
      much displeased me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abricotina returned with these ill tidings, whereat the princess was
      almost distracted; and this was soon perceived by Leander, who was near
      her, though she did not see him. He beheld her grief with the greatest
      pain. However, he durst not then open his lips; but recollecting that
      Furibon was exceedingly covetous, he thought that, by giving him a sum of
      money, he might perhaps prevail with him to retire. Thereupon, he dressed
      himself like an Amazon, and wished himself in the forest, to catch his
      horse. He had no sooner called him than Gris-de-line came leaping,
      prancing, and neighing for joy, for he was grown quite weary of being so
      long absent from his dear master; but when he beheld him dressed as a
      woman he hardly knew him. However, at the sound of his voice, he suffered
      the prince to mount, and they soon arrived in the camp at Furibon, where
      they gave notice that a lady was come to speak with him from the Princess
      of Calm Delights. Immediately the little fellow put on his royal robes,
      and having placed himself upon his throne, he looked like a great toad
      counterfeiting a king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander harangued him, and told him that the princess, preferring a quiet
      and peaceable life to the fatigues of war, had sent to offer his majesty
      as much money as he pleased to demand, provided he would suffer her to
      continue in peace; but if he refused her proposal, she would omit no means
      that might serve for her defense. Furibon replied that he took pity on
      her, and would grant her the honor of his protection; but that he demanded
      a hundred thousand millions of pounds, and without which he would not
      return to his kingdom. Leander answered that such a vast sum would be too
      long a-counting, and therefore, if he would say how many rooms full he
      desired to have, the princess was generous and rich enough to satisfy him.
      Furibon was astonished to hear that, instead of entreating, she would
      rather offer more; and it came into his wicked mind to take all the money
      he could get, and then seize the Amazon and kill her, that she might never
      return to her mistress. He told Leander, therefore, that he would have
      thirty chambers of gold, all full to the ceiling. Leander, being conducted
      into the chambers, took his rose and shook it, till every room was filled
      with all sorts of coin. Furibon was in an ecstasy, and the more gold he
      saw the greater was his desire to get hold of the Amazon; so that when all
      the rooms were full, he commanded his guards to seize her, alleging she
      had brought him counterfeit money. Immediately Leander put on his little
      red cap and disappeared. The guards, believing that the lady had escaped,
      ran out and left Furibon alone; when Leander, availing himself of the
      opportunity, took the tyrant by the hair, and twisted his head off with
      the same ease he would a pullet's; nor did the little wretch of a king see
      that hand that killed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander having got his enemy's head, wished himself in the Palace of Calm
      Delights, where he found the princess walking, and with grief considering
      the message which her mother had sent her, and on the means to repel
      Furibon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she beheld a head hanging in the air, with nobody to hold it.
      This prodigy astonished her so that she could not tell what to think of
      it; but her amazement was increased when she saw the head laid at her
      feet, and heard a voice utter these words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Charming Princess, cease your fear
     Of Furibon; whose head see here."
</pre>
    <p>
      Abricotina, knowing Leander's voice, cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I protest, madam, the invisible person who speaks is the very stranger
      that rescued me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess seemed astonished, but yet pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said she, "if it be true that the invisible and the stranger are the
      same person, I confess I shall be glad to make him my acknowledgments."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leander, still invisible, replied, "I will yet do more to deserve them;"
      and so saying he returned to Furibon's army, where the report of the
      king's death was already spread throughout the camp. As soon as Leander
      appeared there in his usual habit, everybody knew him; all the officers
      and soldiers surrounded him, uttering the loudest acclamations of joy. In
      short, they acknowledged him for their king, and that the crown of right
      belonged to him, for which he thanked them, and, as the first mark of his
      royal bounty, divided the thirty rooms of gold among the soldiers. This
      done he returned to his princess, ordering his army to march back into his
      kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess was gone to bed. Leander, therefore, retired into his own
      apartment, for he was very sleepy&mdash;so sleepy that he forgot to bolt
      his door; and so it happened that the princess, rising early to taste the
      morning air, chanced to enter into this very chamber, and was astonished
      to find a young prince asleep upon the bed. She took a full view of him,
      and was convinced that he was the person whose picture she had in her
      diamond box. "It is impossible," said she, "that this should be a spirit;
      for can spirits sleep? Is this a body composed of air and fire, without
      substance, as Abricotina told me?" She softly touched his hair, and heard
      him breathe, and looked at him as if she could have looked forever. While
      she was thus occupied, her mother, the fairy entered with such a noise
      that Leander started out of his sleep. But how deeply was he afflicted to
      behold his beloved princess in the most deplorable condition! Her mother
      dragged her by the hair and loaded her with a thousand bitter reproaches.
      In what grief and consternation were the two young lovers, who saw
      themselves now upon the point of being separated forever! The princess
      durst not open her lips, but cast her eyes upon Leander, as if to beg his
      assistance. He judged rightly that he ought not to deal rudely with a
      power superior to his own, and therefore he sought, by his eloquence and
      submission, to move the incensed fairy. He ran to her, threw himself at
      her feet, and besought her to have pity upon a young prince who would
      never change in his affection for her daughter. The princess, encouraged,
      also embraced her mother's knees, and declared that without Leander she
      should never be happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happy!" cried the fairy; "you know not the miseries of love nor the
      treacheries of which lovers are capable. They bewitch us only to poison
      our lives; I have known it by experience; and will you suffer the same?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there no exception, madam?" replied Leander, and his countenance
      showed him to be one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither tears nor entreaties could move the implacable fairy; and it
      is very probable that she would have never pardoned them, had not the
      lovely Gentilla appeared at that instant in the chamber, more brilliant
      than the sun. Embracing the old fairy:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear sister," said she, "I am persuaded you cannot have forgotten the
      good office I did you when, after your unhappy marriage, you besought a
      readmittance into Fairyland; since then I never desired any favor at your
      hands, but now the time is come. Pardon, then, this lovely princess;
      consent to her nuptials with this young prince. I will engage he shall be
      ever constant to her; the thread of their days shall be spun of gold and
      silk; they shall live to complete your happiness; and I will never forget
      the obligation you lay upon me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charming Gentilla," cried the fairy, "I consent to whatever you desire.
      Come, my dear children, and receive my love." So saying, she embraced them
      both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abricotina, just then entering, cast her eyes upon Leander; she knew him
      again, and saw he was perfectly happy, at which she, too, was quite
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prince," condescendingly said the fairy-mother, "I will remove the Island
      of Calm Delights into your own kingdom, live with you myself, and do you
      great services."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not Prince Leander appreciated this offer, he bowed low, and
      assured his mother-in-law that no favor could be equal to the one he had
      that day received from her hands. This short compliment pleased the fairy
      exceedingly, for she belonged to those ancient days when people used to
      stand a whole day upon one leg complimenting one another. The nuptials
      were performed in a most splendid manner, and the young prince and
      princess lived together happily many years, beloved by all around them.

    <h2>
      PRINCE CHERRY
    </h2>
    <p>
      LONG ago there lived a monarch, who was such a very, honest man that his
      subjects entitled him the Good King. One day, when he was out hunting, a
      little white rabbit, which had been half-killed by his hounds, leaped
      right into his majesty's arms. Said he, caressing it: "This poor creature
      has put itself under my protection, and I will allow no one to injure it."
      So he carried it to his palace, had prepared for it a neat little
      rabbit-hutch, with abundance of the daintiest food, such as rabbits love,
      and there he left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same night, when he was alone in his chamber, there appeared to him a
      beautiful lady. She was dressed neither in gold, nor silver, nor brocade;
      but her flowing robes were white as snow, and she wore a garland of white
      roses on her head. The Good King was greatly astonished at the sight; for
      his door was locked, and he wondered how so dazzling a lady could possibly
      enter; but she soon removed his doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the fairy Candide," said she, with a smiling and gracious air.
      "Passing through the wood where you were hunting, I took a desire to know
      if you were as good as men say you are I therefore changed myself into a
      white rabbit and took refuge in your arms. You saved me and now I know
      that those who are merciful to dum beasts will be ten times more so to
      human beings. You merit the name your subjects give you: you are the Good
      King. I thank you for your protection, and shall be always one of your
      best friends. You have but to say what you most desire, and I promise you
      your wish shall be granted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," replied the king, "if you are a fairy, you must know, without my
      telling you, the wish of my heart. I have one well-beloved son, Prince
      Cherry: whatever kindly feeling you have toward me, extend it to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willingly," said Candide. "I will make him the handsomest, richest, or
      most powerful prince in the world: choose whichever you desire for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "None of the three," returned the father. "I only wish him to be good&mdash;the
      best prince in the whole world. Of what use would riches, power, or beauty
      be to him if he were a bad man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," said the fairy; "but I can not make him good: he must do
      that himself. I can only change his external fortunes; for his personal
      character, the utmost I can promise is to give him good counsel, reprove
      him for his faults, and even punish him, if he will not punish himself.
      You mortals can do the same with your children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes!" said the king, sighing. Still, he felt that the kindness of a
      fairy was something gained for his son, and died not long after, content
      and at peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Cherry mourned deeply, for he dearly loved his father, and would
      have gladly given all his kingdoms and treasures to keep him in life a
      little longer. Two days after the Good King was no more, Prince Cherry was
      sleeping in his chamber, when he saw the same dazzling vision of the fairy
      Candide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promised your father," said she, "to be your best friend, and in pledge
      of this take what I now give you;" and she placed a small gold ring upon
      his finger. "Poor as it looks, it is more precious than diamonds; for
      whenever you do ill it will prick your finger. If, after that warning, you
      still continue in evil, you will lose my friendship, and I shall become
      your direst enemy."'
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she disappeared, leaving Cherry in such amazement that he would
      have believed it all a dream, save for the ring on his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was for a long time so good that the ring never pricked him at all; and
      this made him so cheerful and pleasant in his humor that everybody called
      him "Happy Prince Cherry." But one unlucky day he was out hunting and
      found no sport, which vexed him so much that he showed his ill temper by
      his looks and ways. He fancied his ring felt very tight and uncomfortable,
      but as it did not prick him he took no heed of this: until, re-entering
      his palace, his little pet dog, Bibi, jumped up upon him and was sharply
      told to get away. The creature, accustomed to nothing but caresses, tried
      to attract his attention by pulling at his garments, when Prince Cherry
      turned and gave it a severe kick. At this moment he felt in his finger a
      prick like a pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What nonsense!" said he to himself. "The fairy must be making game of me.
      Why, what great evil have I done! I, the master of a great empire, cannot
      I kick my own dog?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice replied, or else Prince Cherry imagined it, "No, sire; the master
      of a great empire has a right to do good, but not evil. I&mdash;a fairy&mdash;am
      as much above you as you are above your dog. I might punish you, kill you,
      if I chose; but I prefer leaving you to amend your ways. You have been
      guilty of three faults today&mdash;bad temper, passion, cruelty: do better
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince promised, and kept his word a while; but he had been brought up
      by a foolish nurse, who indulged him in every way and was always telling
      him that he would be a king one day, when he might do as he liked in all
      things. He found out now that even a king cannot always do that; it vexed
      him and made him angry. His ring began to prick him so often that his
      little finger was continually bleeding. He disliked this, as was natural,
      and soon began to consider whether it would not be easier to throw the
      ring away altogether than to be constantly annoyed by it. It was such a
      queer thing for a king to have a spot of blood on his finger! At last,
      unable to put up with it any more, he took his ring off and hid it where
      he would never see it; and believed himself the happiest of men, for he
      could now do exactly what he liked. He did it, and became every day more
      and more miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he saw a young girl, so beautiful that, being always accustomed to
      have his own way, he immediately determined to espouse her. He never
      doubted that she would be only too glad to be made a queen, for she was
      very poor. But Zelia&mdash;that was her name&mdash;answered, to his great
      astonishment, that she would rather not marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I displease you?" asked the prince, into whose mind it had never
      entered that he could displease anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, my prince," said the honest peasant maiden. "You are very
      handsome, very charming; but you are not like your father the Good King. I
      will not be your queen, for you would make me miserable."
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the prince's love seemed all to turn to hatred: he gave
      orders to his guards to convey Zelia to a prison near the palace, and then
      took counsel with his foster brother, the one of all his ill companions
      who most incited him to do wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said this man, "if I were in your majesty's place, I would never
      vex myself about a poor silly girl. Feed her on bread and water till she
      comes to her senses; and if she still refuses you, let her die in torment,
      as a warning to your other subjects should they venture to dispute your
      will. You will be disgraced should you suffer yourself to be conquered by
      a simple girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Prince Cherry, "shall I not be disgraced if I harm a creature
      so perfectly innocent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one is innocent who disputes your majesty's authority," said the
      courtier, bowing; "and it is better to commit an injustice than allow it
      to be supposed you can ever be contradicted with impunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      This touched Cherry on his weak point&mdash;his good impulses faded; he
      resolved once more to ask Zelia if she would marry him, and if she again
      refused, to sell her as a slave. Arrived at the cell in which she was
      confined, what was his astonishment to find her gone! He knew not whom to
      accuse, for he had kept the key in his pocket the whole time. At last, the
      foster-brother suggested that the escape of Zelia might have been
      contrived by an old man, Suliman by name, the prince's former tutor, who
      was the only one who now ventured to blame him for anything that he did.
      Cherry sent immediately, and ordered his old friend to be brought to him,
      loaded heavily with irons. Then, full of fury, he went and shut himself up
      in his own chamber, where he went raging to and fro, till startled by a
      noise like a clap of thunder. The fairy Candide stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prince," said she, in a severe voice, "I promised your father to give you
      good counsels and to punish you if you refused to follow them. My counsels
      were forgotten, my punishment despised. Under the figure of a man, you
      have been no better than the beasts you chase: like a lion in fury, a wolf
      in gluttony, a serpent in revenge, and a bull in brutality. Take,
      therefore, in your new form the likeness of all these animals."
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had Prince Cherry heard these words than to his horror he found
      himself transformed into what the Fairy had named. He was a creature with
      the head of a lion, the horns of a bull, the feet of a wolf, and the tail
      of a serpent. At the same time he felt himself transported to a distant
      forest, where, standing on the bank of a stream, he saw reflected in the
      water his own frightful shape, and heard a voice saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at thyself, and know thy soul has become a thousand times uglier
      even than thy body."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cherry recognized the voice of Candide, and in his rage would have sprung
      upon her and devoured her; but he saw nothing and the same voice said
      behind him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cease thy feeble fury, and learn to conquer thy pride by being in
      submission to thine own subjects."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing no more, he soon quitted the stream, hoping at least to get rid of
      the sight of himself; but he had scarcely gone twenty paces when he
      tumbled into a pitfall that was laid to catch bears; the bear-hunters,
      descending from some trees hard by, caught him, chained him, and only too
      delighted to get hold of such a curious-looking animal, led him along with
      them to the capital of his own kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      There great rejoicings were taking place, and the bear-hunters, asking
      what it was all about, were told that it was because Prince Cherry, the
      torment of his subjects, had just been struck dead by a thunderbolt&mdash;just
      punishment of all his crimes. Four courtiers, his wicked companions, had
      wished to divide his throne between them; but the people had risen up
      against them and offered the crown to Suliman, the old tutor whom Cherry
      had ordered to be arrested.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this the poor monster heard. He even saw Suliman sitting upon his own
      throne and trying to calm the populace by representing to them that it was
      not certain Prince Cherry was dead; that he might return one day to
      reassume with honor the crown which Suliman only consented to wear as a
      sort of viceroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know his heart," said the honest and faithful old man; "it is tainted,
      but not corrupt. If alive, he may reform yet, and be all his father over
      again to you, his people, whom he has caused to suffer so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      These words touched the poor beast so deeply that he ceased to beat
      himself against the iron bars of the cage in which the hunters carried him
      about, became gentle as a lamb, and suffered himself to be taken quietly
      to a menagerie, where were kept all sorts of strange and ferocious animals
      a place which he had himself often visited as a boy, but never thought he
      should be shut up there himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he owned he had deserved it all, and began to make amends by
      showing himself very obedient to his keeper. This man was almost as great
      a brute as the animals he had charge of, and when he was in ill humor he
      used to beat them without rhyme or reason. One day, while he was sleeping,
      a tiger broke loose and leaped upon him, eager to devour him. Cherry at
      first felt a thrill of pleasure at the thought of being revenged; then,
      seeing how helpless the man was, he wished himself free, that he might
      defend him. Immediately the doors of his cage opened. The keeper, waking
      up, saw the strange beast leap out, and imagined, of course, that he was
      going to be slain at once. Instead, he saw the tiger lying dead, and the
      strange beast creeping up and laying itself at his feet to be caressed.
      But as he lifted up his hand to stroke it, a voice was heard saying, "Good
      actions never go unrewarded;" and instead of the frightful monster, there
      crouched on the ground nothing but a pretty little dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cherry, delighted to find himself thus metamorphosed, caressed the keeper
      in every possible way, till at last the man took him up into his arms and
      carried him to the king, to whom he related this wonderful story, from
      beginning to end. The queen wished to have the charming little dog; and
      Cherry would have been exceedingly happy could he have forgotten that he
      was originally a man and a king. He was lodged most elegantly, had the
      richest of collars to adorn his neck, and heard himself praised
      continually. But his beauty rather brought him into trouble, for the
      queen, afraid lest he might grow too large for a pet, took advice of
      dog-doctors, who ordered that he should be fed entirely upon bread, and
      that very sparingly; so poor Cherry was sometimes nearly starved.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when they gave him his crust for breakfast, a fancy seized him to
      go and eat it in the palace garden; so he took the bread in his mouth and
      trotted away toward a stream which he knew, and where he sometimes stopped
      to drink. But instead of the stream he saw a splendid palace, glittering
      with gold and precious stones. Entering the doors was a crowd of men and
      women, magnificently dressed; and within there was singing and dancing and
      good cheer of all sorts. Yet, however grandly and gayly the people went
      in, Cherry noticed that those who came out were pale, thin, ragged,
      half-naked, covered with wounds and sores. Some of them dropped dead at
      once; others dragged themselves on a little way and then lay down, dying
      of hunger, and vainly begged a morsel of bread from others who were
      entering in&mdash;who never took the least notice of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cherry perceived one woman, who was trying feebly to gather and eat some
      green herbs. "Poor thing!" said he to himself; "I know what it is to be
      hungry, and I want my breakfast badly enough; but still it will kill me to
      wait till dinner time, and my crust may save the life of this poor woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the little dog ran up to her and dropped his bread at her feet; she
      picked it up and ate it with avidity. Soon she looked quite recovered, and
      Cherry, delighted, was trotting back again to his kennel, when he heard
      loud cries, and saw a young girl dragged by four men to the door of the
      palace, which they were trying to compel her to enter. Oh, how he wished
      himself a monster again, as when he slew the tiger!&mdash;for the young
      girl was no other than his beloved Zelia. Alas! what could a poor little
      dog do to defend her? But he ran forward and barked at the men, and bit
      their heels, until at last they chased him away with heavy blows. And then
      he lay down outside the palace door, determined to watch and see what had
      become of Zelia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscience pricked him now. "What!" thought he, "I am furious against
      these wicked men, who are carrying her away; and did I not do the same
      myself? Did I not cast her into prison, and intend to sell her as a slave?
      Who knows how much more wickedness I might not have done to her and
      others, if Heaven's justice had not stopped me in time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      While he lay thinking and repenting, he heard a window open and saw Zelia
      throw out of it a bit of dainty meat. Cherry, who felt hungry enough by
      this time, was just about to eat it, when the woman to whom he had given
      his crust snatched him up in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor little beast!" cried she, patting him, "every bit of food in that
      palace is poisoned: you shall not touch a morsel."
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the same time the voice in the air repeated again, "Good actions
      never go unrewarded;" and Cherry found himself changed into a beautiful
      little white pigeon. He remembered with joy that white was the color of
      the fairy Candide, and began to hope that she was taking him into favor
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he stretched his wings, delighted that he might now have a chance of
      approaching his fair Zelia. He flew up to the palace windows, and, finding
      one of them open, entered and sought everywhere, but he could not find
      Zelia. Then, in despair, he flew out again, resolved to go over the world
      until he beheld her once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took flight at once and traversed many countries, swiftly as a bird
      can, but found no trace of his beloved. At length in a desert, sitting
      beside an old hermit in his cave and par-taking with him his frugal
      repast, Cherry saw a poor peasant girl and recognized Zelia. Transported
      with joy, he flew in, perched on her shoulder, and expressed his delight
      and affection by a thousand caresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, charmed with the pretty little pigeon, caressed it in her turn, and
      promised it that if it would stay with her she would love it always.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you done, Zelia?" said the hermit, smiling; and while he spoke
      the white pigeon vanished, and there stood Prince Cherry in his own
      natural form. "Your enchantment ended, prince, when Zelia promised to love
      you. Indeed, she has loved you always, but your many faults constrained
      her to hide her love. These are now amended, and you may both live happy
      if you will, because your union is founded upon mutual esteem."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cherry and Zelia threw themselves at the feet of the hermit, whose form
      also began to change. His soiled garments became of dazzling whiteness,
      and his long beard and withered face grew into the flowing hair and lovely
      countenance of the fairy Candide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rise up, my children," said she; "I must now transport you to your palace
      and restore to Prince Cherry his father's crown, of which he is now
      worthy."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had scarcely ceased speaking when they found themselves in the chamber
      of Suliman, who, delighted to find again his beloved pupil and master,
      willingly resigned the throne, and became the most faithful of his
      subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Cherry and Queen Zelia reigned together for many years, and it is
      said that the former was so blameless and strict in all his duties that
      though he constantly wore the ring which Candide had restored to him, it
      never once pricked his finger enough to make it bleed.

    <h2>
      THE PRINCE WITH THE NOSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      THERE was once a king who was passionately in love with a beautiful
      princess, but she could not be married because a magician had enchanted
      her. The king went to a good fairy to inquire what he should do. Said the
      fairy, after receiving him graciously: "Sir, I will tell you a great
      secret. The princess has a great cat whom she loves so well that she cares
      for nothing and nobody else; but she will be obliged to marry any person
      who is adroit enough to walk upon the cat's tail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will not be very difficult," thought the king to himself, and
      departed, resolving to trample the cat's tail to pieces rather than not
      succeed in walking upon it. He went immediately to the palace of his fair
      mistress and the cat; the animal came in front of him, arching its back in
      anger as it was wont to do. The king lifted up his foot, thinking nothing
      would be so easy as to tread on the tail, but he found himself mistaken.
      Minon&mdash;that was the creature's name&mdash;twisted itself round so
      sharply that the king only hurt his own foot by stamping on the floor. For
      eight days did he pursue the cat everywhere: up and down the palace he was
      after it from morning till night, but with no better success; the tail
      seemed made of quicksilver, so very lively was it. At last the king had
      the good fortune to catch Minon sleeping, when tramp! tramp! he trod on
      the tail with all his force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minon woke up, mewed horribly, and immediately changed from a cat into a
      large, fierce-looking man, who regarded the king with flashing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must marry the princess," cried he, "because you have broken the
      enchantment in which I held her; but I will be revenged on you. You shall
      have a son with a nose as long as&mdash;that;" he made in the air a curve
      of half a foot; "yet he shall believe it is just like all other noses, and
      shall be always unfortunate till he has found out it is not. And if you
      ever tell anybody of this threat of mine, you shall die on the spot." So
      saying the magician disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, who was at first much terrified, soon began to laugh at this
      adventure. "My son might have a worse misfortune than too long a nose,"
      thought he. "At least it will hinder him neither in seeing nor hearing. I
      will go and find the princess and marry her at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so, but he only lived a few months after, and died before his
      little son was born, so that nobody knew anything about the secret of the
      nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little prince was so much wished for that when he came into the world
      they agreed to call him Prince Wish. He had beautiful blue eyes and a
      sweet little mouth, but his nose was so big that it covered half his face.
      The queen, his mother, was inconsolable; but her ladies tried to satisfy
      her by telling her that the nose was not nearly so large as it seemed,
      that it would grow smaller as the prince grew bigger, and that if it did
      not a large nose was indispensable to a hero. All great soldiers, they
      said, had great noses, as everybody knew. The queen was so very fond of
      her son that she listened eagerly to all this comfort. Shortly she grew so
      used to the princes's nose that it did not seem to her any larger than
      ordinary noses of the court; where, in process of time, everybody with a
      long nose was very much admired, and the unfortunate people who had only
      snubs were taken very little notice of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great care was observed in the education of the prince; and as soon as he
      could speak they told him all sorts of amusing tales, in which all the bad
      people had short noses, and all the good people had long ones. No person
      was suffered to come near him who had not a nose of more than ordinary
      length; nay, to such an extent did the countries carry their fancy, that
      the noses of all the little babies were ordered to be pulled out as far as
      possible several times a day, in order to make them grow. But grow as they
      would, they never could grow as long as that of Prince Wish. When he was
      old enough his tutor taught him history; and whenever any great king or
      lovely princess was referred to, the tutor always took care to mention
      that he or she had a long nose. All the royal apartments were filled with
      pictures and portraits having this peculiarity, so that at last Prince
      Wish began to regard the length of his nose as his greatest perfection,
      and would not have had it an inch less even to save his crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was twenty years old his mother and his people wished him to
      marry. They procured for him the likenesses of many princesses, but the
      one he preferred was Princess Darling, daughter of a powerful monarch and
      heiress to several kingdoms. Alas! with all her beauty, this princess had
      one great misfortune, a little turned-up nose, which, every one else said
      made her only the more bewitching. But here, in the kingdom of Prince
      Wish, the courtiers were thrown by it into the utmost perplexity. They
      were in the habit of laughing at all small noses; but how dared they make
      fun of the nose of Princess Darling? Two unfortunate gentlemen, whom
      Prince Wish had overheard doing so, were ignominiously banished from the
      court and capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, the courtiers became alarmed, and tried to correct their habit
      of speech; but they would have found themselves in constant difficulties,
      had not one clever person struck out a bright idea. He said that though it
      was indispensably necessary for a man to have a great nose, women were
      very different; and that a learned man had discovered in a very old
      manuscript that the celebrated Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, the beauty of
      the ancient world, had a turned-up nose. At this information Prince Wish
      was so delighted that he made the courtier a very handsome present, and
      immediately sent off ambassadors to demand Princess Darling in marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She accepted his offer at once, and returned with the ambassadors. He made
      all haste to meet and welcome her, but when she was only three leagues
      distant from his capital, before he had time even to kiss her hand, the
      magician who had once assumed the shape of his mother's cat, Minon,
      appeared in the air and carried her off before the lover's very eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Wish, almost beside himself with grief, declared that nothing
      should induce him to return to his throne and kingdom till he had found
      Darling. He would suffer none of his courtiers or attendants to follow
      him; but bidding them all adieu, mounted a good horse, laid the reins on
      the animal's neck, and let him take him wherever he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse entered a wide-extended plain, and trotted on steadily the whole
      day without finding a single house. Master and beast began almost to faint
      with hunger; and Prince Wish might have wished himself at home again, had
      he not discovered, just at dusk, a cavern, where there sat, beside a
      bright lantern, a little woman who might have been more than a hundred
      years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put on her spectacles the better to look at the stranger, and he
      noticed that her nose was so small that the spectacles would hardly stay
      on; then the prince and the fairy&mdash;for she was a fairy&mdash;burst
      into laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a funny nose!" cried the one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so funny as yours, madam," returned the other. "But pray let us leave
      our noses alone, and be good enough to give me something to eat, for I am
      dying with hunger, and so is my poor horse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all my heart," answered the fairy. "Although your nose is
      ridiculously long, you are no less the son of one of my best friends. I
      loved your father like a brother; he had a very handsome nose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is wanting to my nose?" asked Wish rather savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! nothing at all. On the contrary, there is a great deal too much of
      it; but never mind, one may be a very honest man, and yet have too big a
      nose. As I said, I was a great friend of your father's; he came often to
      see me. I was very pretty then, and oftentimes he used to say to me, 'My
      sister&mdash;&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will hear the rest, madam, with pleasure, when I have supped; but will
      you condescend to remember that I have tasted nothing all day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor boy," said the fairy, "I will give you some supper directly; and
      while you eat it I will tell you my history in six words, for I hate much
      talking. A long tongue is as insupportable as a long nose; and I remember
      when I was young how much I used to be admired because I was not a talker;
      indeed, some one said to the queen my mother&mdash;for poor as you see me
      now, I am the daughter of a great king, who always&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ate when he was hungry, I hope," interrupted the prince, whose patience
      was fast departing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," said the imperturbable old fairy; "and I will bring you
      your supper directly, only I wish first just to say that the king my
      father&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang the king your father!" Prince Wish was about to exclaim, but he
      stopped himself, and only observed that however the pleasure of her
      conversation might make him forget his hunger, it could not have the same
      effect upon his horse, who was really starving.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fairy, pleased at his civility, called her servants and bade them
      supply him at once with all he needed. "And," added she, "I must say you
      are very polite and very good-tempered, in spite of your nose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has the old woman to do with my nose?" thought the prince. "If I
      were not so very hungry, I would soon show her what she is&mdash;a regular
      old gossip and chatterbox. She to fancy she talks little, indeed! One must
      be very foolish not to know one's own defects. This comes of being born a
      princess. Flatterers have spoiled her and persuaded her that she talks
      little. Little, indeed! I never knew anybody chatter so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      While the prince thus meditated, the servants were laying the table, the
      fairy asking them a hundred unnecessary questions, simply for the pleasure
      of hearing herself talk. "Well," thought Wish, "I am delighted that I came
      hither, if only to learn how wise I have been in never listening to
      flatterers, who hide from us our faults, or make us believe they are
      perfections. But they could never deceive me. I know all my own weak
      points, I trust." As truly he believed he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went on eating contentedly, nor stopped till the old fairy began to
      address him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prince," said she, "will you be kind enough to turn a little? Your nose
      casts such a shadow that I cannot see what is on my plate. And, as I was
      saying, your father admired me and always made me welcome at court. What
      is the court etiquette there now? Do the ladies still go to assemblies,
      promenades, balls?&mdash;I beg your pardon for laughing, but how very long
      your nose is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you would cease to speak of my nose," said the prince, becoming
      annoyed. "It is what it is, and I do not desire it any shorter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I see that I have vexed you," returned the fairy. "Nevertheless, I am
      one of your best friends, and so I shall take the liberty of always&mdash;&mdash;"
      She would doubtless have gone on talking till midnight; but the prince,
      unable to bear it any longer, here interrupted her, thanked her for her
      hospitality, bade her a hasty adieu, and rode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He traveled for a long time, half over the world, but he heard no news of
      Princess Darling. However, in each place he went to, he heard one
      remarkable fact&mdash;the great length of his own nose. The little boys in
      the streets jeered at him, the peasants stared at him, and the more polite
      ladies and gentlemen whom he met in society used to try in vain to keep
      from laughing, and to get out of his way as soon as they could. So the
      poor prince became gradually quite forlorn and solitary; he thought all
      the world was mad, but still he never thought of there being anything
      queer about his own nose. At last the old fairy, who, though she was a
      chatterbox, was very good-natured; saw that he was almost breaking his
      heart. She felt sorry for him and wished to help him in spite of himself,
      for she knew the enchantment which hid from him the Princess Darling could
      never be broken till he had discovered his own defect. So she went in
      search of the princess, and being more powerful than the magician, since
      she was a good fairy and he was an evil magician, she got her away from
      him and shut her up in a palace of crystal, which she placed on the road
      which Prince Wish had to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was riding along, very melancholy, when he saw the palace; and at its
      entrance was a room, made of the purest glass, in which sat his beloved
      princess, smiling and beautiful as ever. He leaped from his horse and ran
      toward her. She held out her hand for him to kiss, but he could not get at
      it for the glass. Transported with eagerness and delight, he dashed his
      sword through the crystal and succeeded in breaking a small opening, to
      which she put up her beautiful rosy mouth. But it was in vain; Prince Wish
      could not approach it. He twisted his neck about, and turned his head on
      all sides, till at length, putting up his hand to his face, he discovered
      the impediment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be confessed," exclaimed he, "that my nose is too long."
    </p>
    <p>
      That moment the glass walls all split asunder, and the old fairy appeared,
      leading Princess Darling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Avow, prince," said she, "that you are very much obliged to me, for now
      the enchantment is ended. You may marry the object of your choice. But,"
      added she, smiling, "I fear I might have talked to you forever on the
      subject of your nose, and you would not have believed me in its length,
      till it became an obstacle to your own inclinations. Now behold it!" and
      she held up a crystal mirror. "Are you satisfied to be no different from
      other people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly," said Prince Wish, who found his nose had shrunk to an
      ordinary length. And taking the Princess Darling by the hand, he kissed
      her courteously, affectionately, and satisfactorily. Then they departed to
      their own country, and lived very happily all their days.

    <h2>
      THE FROG-PRINCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN times of yore, when wishes were both heard and granted, lived a king
      whose daughters were all beautiful but the youngest was so lovely that the
      sun himself, who has seen so much, wondered at her beauty every time he
      looked in her face. Now, near the king's castle was a large dark forest;
      and in the forest, under an old linden tree, was a deep well. When the day
      was very hot, the king's daughter used to go to the wood and seat herself
      at the edge of the cool well; and when she became wearied, she would take
      a golden ball, throw it up in the air, and catch it again. This was her
      favorite amusement. Once it happened that her golden ball, instead of
      falling back into the little hand that she stretched out for it, dropped
      on the ground, and immediately rolled away into the water. The king's
      daughter followed it with her eyes, but the ball had vanished, and the
      well was so deep that no one could see down to the bottom. Then she began
      to weep, wept louder and louder every minute, and could not console
      herself at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was thus lamenting some one called to her: "What is the matter
      with you, king's daughter? You weep so that you would touch the heart of a
      stone."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked around to see whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching
      his thick ugly head out of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! it is you, old water-paddler!" said she. "I am crying for my golden
      ball, which has fallen into the well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be content," answered the frog; "I dare say I can give you some good
      advice; but what will you give me if I bring back your plaything to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever you like, dear frog," said she, "my clothes, my pearls and
      jewels, even the golden crown I wear."
    </p>
    <p>
      The frog answered, "Your clothes, your pearls and jewels, even your golden
      crown, I do not care for; but if you will love me, and let me be your
      companion and play-fellow, sit near you at your little table, eat from
      your little golden plate, drink from your little cup, and sleep in your
      little bed&mdash;if you will promise me this, then I will bring you back
      your golden ball from the bottom of the well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes!" said she; "I promise you every-thing, if you will only bring me
      back my golden ball."
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought to herself, meanwhile: "What nonsense the silly frog talks! He
      sits in the water with the other frogs, and croaks, and cannot be
      anybody's playfellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the frog, as soon as he had received the promise dipped his head under
      the water and sank down. In a little while up he came again with the ball
      in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The king's daughter was overjoyed
      when she beheld her pretty plaything again, picked it up, and ran away
      with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait! wait!" cried the frog; "take me with you. I cannot run as fast as
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! of what use was it that he croaked after her as loud as he could.
      She would not listen to him, but hastened home, and soon forgot the poor
      frog, who was obliged to plunge again to the bottom of his well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, when she was sitting at dinner with the king and all the
      courtiers, eating from her little gold plate, there came a sound of
      something creeping up the marble staircase&mdash;splish, splash; and when
      it had reached the top, it knocked at the door and cried, "Youngest king's
      daughter, open to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran, wishing to see who was outside; but when she opened the door and
      there sat the frog, she flung it hastily to again and sat down at table,
      feeling very, very uncomfortable. The king saw that her heart was beating
      violently, and said, "How, my child, why are you afraid? Is a giant
      standing outside the door to carry you off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!" answered she, "it is no giant, but a nasty frog, who yesterday,
      when I was playing in the wood near the well, fetched my golden ball out
      of the water. For this I promised him he should be my companion, but I
      never thought he could come out of his well. Now he is at the door, and
      wants to come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, the second time there was a knock, and a voice cried:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Youngest king's daughter,
     Open to me;
     Know you what yesterday
     You promised me,
     By the cool water?
     Youngest king's daughter,
     Open to me."
</pre>
    <p>
      Then said the king, "What you promised you must perform. Go and open the
      door."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went and opened the door; the frog hopped in, always following and
      following her till he came up to her chair. There he sat and cried out,
      "Lift me up to you on the table."
    </p>
    <p>
      She refused, till the king, her father, commanded her to do it. When the
      frog was on the table, he said, "Now push your little golden plate nearer
      to me, that we may eat together." She did as he desired, but one could
      easily see that she did it unwillingly. The frog seemed to enjoy his
      dinner very much, but every morsel she ate stuck in the throat of the poor
      little princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said the frog, "I have eaten enough, and am tired; carry me to your
      little room, and make your little silken bed smooth, and we will lay
      ourselves down to sleep together."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the daughter of the king began to weep; for she was afraid of the
      cold frog, who wanted to sleep in her pretty clean bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the king looked angrily at her, and said again: "What you have
      promised you must perform. The frog is your companion."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no use to complain; whether she liked it or not, she was obliged to
      take the frog with her up to her little bed. So she picked him up with two
      fingers, hating him bitterly the while, and carried him upstairs: but when
      she got into bed, instead of lifting him up to her, she threw him with all
      her strength against the wall, saying, "Now you nasty frog, there will be
      an end of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      But what fell down from the wall was not a dead frog, but a living young
      prince, with beautiful and loving eyes, who at once became, by her own
      promise and her father's will, her dear companion and husband. He told her
      how he had been cursed by a wicked sorceress, and that no one but the
      king's youngest daughter could release him from his enchantment and take
      him out of the well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day a carriage drove up to the palace gates with eight white
      horses, having white feathers on their heads and golden reins. Behind it
      stood the servant of the young prince, called the faithful Henry. This
      faithful Henry had been so grieved when his master was changed into a frog
      that he had been compelled to have three iron bands fastened round his
      heart, lest it should break. Now the carriage came to convey the prince to
      his kingdom, so the faithful Henry lifted in the bride and bridegroom and
      mounted behind, full of joy at his lord's release. But when they had gone
      a short distance, the prince heard behind him a noise as if something was
      breaking. He cried out, "Henry, the carriage is breaking!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Henry replied: "No, sir, it is not the carriage but one of the bands
      from my heart, with which I was forced to bind it up, or it would have
      broken with grief while you sat as a frog at the bottom of the well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice again this happened, and the prince always thought the carriage was
      breaking; but it was only the bands breaking off from the heart of the
      faithful Henry, out of joy that his lord, the frog-prince, was a frog no
      more.

    <h2>
      CLEVER ALICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      ONCE upon a time there was a man who had a daughter who was called "Clever
      Alice," and when she was grown up, her father said, "We must see about her
      marrying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied her mother, "whenever a young man shall appear who is
      worthy of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      At last a certain youth, by name Hans, came from a distance to make a
      proposal of marriage; but he required one condition, that the clever Alice
      should be very prudent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said her father, "no fear of that! she has got a head full of
      brains;" and the mother added, "ah, she can see the wind blow up the
      street, and hear the flies cough!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," replied Hans; "but remember, if she is not very prudent, I
      will not take her." Soon afterward they sat down to dinner, and her mother
      said, "Alice, go down into the cellar and draw some beer."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Clever Alice took the jug down from the wall, and went into the cellar,
      jerking the lid up and down on her way, to pass away the time. As soon as
      she got downstairs she drew a stool and placed it before the cask, in
      order that she might not have to stoop, for she thought stooping might in
      some way injure her back and give it an undesirable bend. Then she placed
      the can before her and turned the tap, and while the beer was running, as
      she did not wish her eyes to be idle, she looked about upon the wall above
      and below. Presently she perceived, after much peeping into this corner
      and that corner, a hatchet, which the bricklayers had left behind?
      sticking out of the ceiling right above her head. At the sight of this
      Clever Alice began to cry, saying, "Oh! if I marry Hans, and we have a
      child, and he grows up, and we send him into the cellar to draw beer, the
      hatchet will fall upon his head and kill him," and so she sat there
      weeping with all her might over the impending misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the good folks upstairs were waiting for the beer, but as Clever
      Alice did not come, her mother told the maid to go and see what she was
      stopping for. The maid went down into the cellar and found Alice sitting
      before the cask crying heartily, and she asked, "Alice, what are you
      weeping about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," she replied, "have I not cause? If I marry Hans, and we have a
      child, and he grows up, and we send him here to draw beer, that hatchet
      will fall upon his head and kill him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said the maid, "what a clever Alice we have!" And sitting down, she
      began to weep, too, for the misfortune that was to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while, when the servant did not return, the good folks above began
      to feel very thirsty; so the husband told the boy to go down into the
      cellar and see what had become of Alice and the maid. The boy went down,
      and there sat Clever Alice and the maid both crying, so he asked the
      reason; and Alice told him the same tale, of the hatchet that was to fall
      on her child, if she married Hans, and if they had a child. When she had
      finished, the boy exclaimed, "What a clever Alice we have!" and fell
      weeping and howling with the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs they were still waiting, and the husband said, when the boy did
      not return, "Do you go down, wife, into the cellar and see why Alice stays
      so long." So she went down, and finding all three sitting there crying,
      asked the reason, and Alice told her about the hatchet which must
      inevitably fall upon the head of her son. Then the mother likewise
      exclaimed, "Oh, what a clever Alice we have!" and, sitting down, began to
      weep as much as any of the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the husband waited for his wife's return; but at last he felt so
      very thirsty that he said, "I must go myself down into the cellar and see
      what is keeping our Alice." As soon as he entered the cellar, there he
      found the four sitting and crying together, and when he heard the reason,
      he also exclaimed, "Oh, what a clever Alice we have!" and sat down to cry
      with the whole strength of his lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the bridegroom above sat waiting, but when nobody returned,
      he thought they must be waiting for him, and so he went down to see what
      was the matter. When he entered, there sat the five crying and groaning,
      each one in a louder key than his neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What misfortune has happened?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, dear Hans!" cried Alice, "if you and I should marry one another, and
      have a child, and he grew up, and we, perhaps, send him down to this
      cellar to tap the beer, the hatchet which has been left sticking up there
      may fall on his head, and so kill him; and do you not think this is enough
      to weep about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said Hans, "more prudence than this is not necessary for my
      housekeeping; because you are such a clever Alice, I will have you for my
      wife." And, taking her hand, he led her home, and celebrated the wedding
      directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they had been married a little while, Hans, said one morning, "Wife,
      I will go out to work and earn some money; do you go into the field and
      gather some corn wherewith to make bread."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she answered, "I will do so, dear Hans." And when he was gone, she
      cooked herself a nice mess of pottage to take with her. As she came to the
      field, she said to herself, "What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or eat
      first? Aye, I will eat first!" Then she ate up the contents of her pot,
      and when it was finished, she thought to herself, "Now, shall I reap first
      or sleep first? Well, I think I will have a nap!" and so she laid herself
      down among the corn, and went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Hans returned home, but Alice did not come, and so he said, "Oh,
      what a prudent Alice I have! She is so industrious that she does not even
      come home to eat anything." By and by, however, evening came on, and still
      she did not return; so Hans went out to see how much she had reaped; but,
      behold, nothing at all, and there lay Alice fast asleep among the corn! So
      home he ran very fast, and brought a net with little bells hanging on it,
      which he threw over her head while she still slept on. When he had done
      this, he went back again and shut to the house door, and, seating himself
      on his stool, began working very industriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, when it was nearly dark, the clever Alice awoke, and as soon as
      she stood up, the net fell all over her hair, and the bells jingled at
      every step she took. This quite frightened her, and she began to doubt
      whether she were really Clever Alice, and said to herself, "Am I she, or
      am I not?" This was a question she could not answer, and she stood still a
      long while considering about it. At last she thought she would go home and
      ask whether she was really herself&mdash;supposing somebody would be able
      to tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came up to the house door it was shut; so she tapped at the
      window, and asked, "Hans, is Alice within?" "Yes," he replied, "she is."
      At which answer she became really terrified, and exclaiming, "Ah, heaven,
      then I am not Alice!" she ran up to another house, intending to ask the
      same question. But as soon as the folks within heard the jingling of the
      bells in her net, they refused to open their doors, and nobody would
      receive her. So she ran straight away from the village, and no one has
      ever seen her since.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
